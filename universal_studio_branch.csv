Kelly B,2.0," May 30, 2021",Universal is a complete Disaster - stick with Disney!,"We went to Universal over Memorial Day weekend and it was a total train wreck. We waited to get in the parking lot for about forty minutes. We paid for prime parking to make up for all the wasted time.  Then we paid extra for the express pass 2-park tickets only to be turned away and sent to guest services bc the app didn’t show the bar code. The line at guest services took forever. They are clearly understaffed. We were sent to yet another guest services line because we had the express passes! Also took ages! We spent nearly 2 hours just trying to enter the park! When we shared this with Jackie at guest services she smirked, didn’t even apologize and was patronizing. This would never happen at Disney.  Once inside several of the rides didn’t work, when they reopened they were backed up so the express line on some rides was still a FULL HOUR wait and two hours without the express pass! We also saw people jump over and sneak in to the express lanes and then convince the workers to just let them on if there was a check point and it worked. We felt like complete suckers for paying for the express pass that still left us in long lines and that other people who didn’t pay could just sneak in to.  There were long lines to buy water, to use a restroom, to get a butter beer- it sucked.  Horrible day. Avoid this place, it’s a total disaster!",Universal Studios Florida
Jon,1.0," May 30, 2021",Food is hard to get.,The food service is horrible. I’m not reviewing the food. It’s the wait time!!!! 45 minutes minimum to get to the one cashier working at each place. Ruins the whole experience. 5 closed cash registers.,Universal Studios Florida
Nerdy P,2.0," May 30, 2021",Disappointed,"I booked this vacation mainly to ride Hagrid motorcycle adventure; very disappointing to find out the only way to ride it is through ""Virtual line"". I've spent my entire vacation trying to find a spot, but always got the same message ""No virtual line times left"". It seems very strange to me how suddenly the ride changes from 30 minutes wait, to no virtual line times left. I strongly believe that whoever is responsible for running this virtual line, is actually prebooking all the times available throughout the day to whoever they want to. Costumer services is very poor to say the least, and clearly not only doesn't care to address my complaints, but also very unapologetic, defiant. It's true what I've heard ""we are not in Disney, we don't have to be nice"". Every time we wanted to eat in any location at any park, there was always a huge line waiting to be served or seated. All 3 parks were filthy, trash everywhere. This review probably will not make any difference to Universal, probably won't get to be read at all. Some agent I was chatting with already said it when I told them I was considering not coming back, he/she simply said ""No problem!"" At least I get to express my feelings based on my experience. Hopefully it will be helpful to a potential guests.",Universal Studios Florida
ran101278,4.0," May 29, 2021",My opinion,"When a person tries the test seat for the rides, and gets the green light, they should not have to go through a long line just to be turned away because the ride operators say they can't get in the actual seat. And giving out express passes to the group does not rectify that situation.",Universal Studios Florida

I never knew who Jason Bourne was... but now I will be buying the movies. This was absolutely awesome, amazing and 100% worth the entire cost of the trip by itself. So worth the wait and every time I went it was packed. I would have passed it up thinking it was nothing WRONG!!!! ...DONT MISS THIS!!!!",Universal Studios Florida
John,1.0," May 28, 2021",This is not a vacation,Worst experience I have ever had the rides are outdated the whole place smell like vomit where ever you go theres long waiting times the staff are super disrispectfull at restorants especially bubba camp the manager and staff are super rude disrespectful uncaring. This isn’t a vacation,Universal Studios Florida
annapN7702ZW,2.0," May 27, 2021",Expected More,"I just expected more. Alot of waiting around, lack of staffing and over priced tickets for what you actually get. They wanted over $700 bucks for a cabana at Volcano Bay! The express passes were close to $150.00 bucks. They need to take lessons from Disney as they seem to have the crowd control down. City Walk was just a bunch of kids hanging out all night. Just Eh. It's been 15 years since my last visit and now I know why.",Universal Studios Florida
Deb P,2.0," May 27, 2021",Disapointing.....,"This was my 4th trip with my daughter to Universal and unfortunately my most disappointing. Most of which had nothing to do with Covid restrictions. We stayed on-site at the Hard Rock and of course had the fast passes. At the time of our stay May 18-22 there was no housekeeping at all. All trash and used towels were left in the hallway and a phone call had to be made for fresh towels. So walking down the hallway to dirty towels and trash wasn't the most pleasant experience. Hotel aside my biggest complaints were the crowds and long lines for the rides and food. Fast passes were of course not available on the newer attractions, so 1 hour plus waits for those rides. Most other rides were about 1/2 the wait time. Most sit down restaurants in the park and at city walk had no walk up times and reservations were few and far between. Make sure you make them well ahead of time as there was limited seating. Take out at the food court at city walk was well over an hour. They were well under staffed (3 employees at Moe's) and the line was far out the door. The area was dirty and the trash was overflowing. It just appears as Universal is not prepared for the crowds they are letting in. I guess we just expected more for the money we spent. We love Universal, but I am very leary about coming back anytime soon.",Universal Studios Florida
Chuck N,1.0," May 27, 2021",Greed makes for a terrible guest experience,"Universal is one thing - Not Disney. Everything Disney does well Universal dues poorly. We arrived just before opening (9 AM) and exited our car in the marking deck. We were met with a line so long it went from security, all the way across 2 bridges and circled back on itself 4 times in the marking deck. After an hour we realized the line was not really being enforced and people were going around so we followed a small crowd up closer and still had another 1/2 hour wait to get in. There were NO employees helping to direct traffic or people. I asked an employee once we got through security and they simply said that they were not limiting the parks and that they were extremely short staffed. Only about 1/3 of the employees had been hired back but the crowds were overwhelming them.  The rest of the day went about the same. 1 hour for coffee. 1.5 hours to get food. We managed to ride ONE ride in 7 hours and finally left due to frustration.  Not much changes. If you have been before don't waste your time. For the first time Harry Potter fans its interesting to walk around and shop but good luck doing much. 90+ minutes to ride the hogwarts express.  They did have mask policies but no one was around to enforce them so what was the point? They had hand sanitizer stations but I did not find a single one with anything in it. They clearly care about $$ and not guests or employees. I won't be back and I'd take a Disney park (which were below capacity and a great experience for less $$) any day.",Universal Studios Florida
Jen,4.0," May 26, 2021",Good first time visit with kids,"We spent 6 nights on site at Sapphire Falls as a family of 6 (2 adults, 4 kids age 5-14) with a 4 day park hopper pass. We did not get the express pass, but if you want to do rides and aren't there for four days, I don't know how you would experience this park without them. The early park admission didn't do much as only Universal Studios offered it during the days we were there. This ended up being the busiest times of Wizarding World throughout the day and the longest line at the gate. We did Universal Studios and Islands of Adventure Thursday, Friday, Sunday, and Monday to avoid the Saturday crowd. Sunday was the lightest day with regard to crowds.  The theme park did a great job of immersion in the lines and having a little something for everyone. If you are pregnant or are prone to motion sickness, you will struggle to find rides you can do. Our little ones loved Fieval's playland and Dr. Seuss Landing. They also enjoyed the Men in Black Ride. Our older kiddos, who were new to theme parks and coasters, enjoyed a varied array of rides and shows. Animal Antics show was ok- Indianapolis zoo has one similar but much better. Bourne Stuntactcular was amazing. The Ripsaw falls and Popeye's barge were a hoot.  Wizarding World was quite neat. So well done to every fine detail. Unfortunately, employees don't seem to get that memo and ruin the ""magic"" a bit. Gringotts and Hagrid's were amazing rides. Worth the wait. We found Gringotts rarely had a line around 10am after the initial early entrance arrivals went through. Hagrid's line went down the lowest around noon (45 minutes).  We had a lovely time and it was a memorable vacation. Here are a few things to keep in mind or I wish Universal would improve on:  --I don't think I encountered any ""above and beyond"" employees. Most seemed annoyed that guests were in the park. I felt like a stone in their shoe rather than a guest. It was a rare occurrence to get a friendly wave as we entered or left a line.  --Breakfast at the Three Broomsticks was absolutely horrendous (we had breakfast tickets with our package). The girl's pancakes were stale as though they had sat for a couple hours under a heat lamp. It took almost 20 minutes after being seated for someone to come to our table and the place was mostly empty. My eggs were obviously some powdered version and were barely edible. Once the food was delivered, no one came by to refill drinks or ask us about our food. Thankfully, the food and experience at the Leaky Cauldron was 100% better.  --The ""quick service"" dining locations where you mobile ordered and they brought food to your table was incredibly slow- usually about a 45-60 minute wait for food. There was no way to order cups of water on the mobile device, and when we asked for it when the waiter brought our food they seemed quite put out by the request. Maybe this wait is normal, but it was unexpected for us. It was so hard to find water in the park and you always felt like you were the biggest annoyance when asking for it. Many of the freestyle machines (I had been told you could get water from for free) did not offer free water.  --I stood in quite a few lines where the employees were much more interested in talking to one another than interacting with guests. In one line, they were talking about how hammered they had gotten at a party over the weekend. Another kept complaining about how hot and tired they were to another employee and couldn't wait to go on break. These were just a couple of examples. It was as if the park guests were invisible.  --We went knowing the mask rules, followed them to the best of our ability, and were thankful for the ability to not wear them outside when not in line. However, the rules did not make any sense in some instances. The most aggressive employees about masks were on the Red Fish, Blue Fish ride. They would literally interrupt the whole ride and song when a kid's mask fell off in flight below their nose or they moved it down when it got wet. These kids are outside, in the air moving, and at least 15 feet apart from each other. Literally, there is essentially no risk or reason to have masks on in that environment- why interrupt the ride to yell at them? It was just annoying.  One way they did GREAT in the park as we got shut down twice on rides and they did a great job of making it right. Men in Black broke down while we were on it. They kept us all calm and escorted us out with laughter and smiles and a one-time express pass. We waited in line for over an hour for Hagrids when it broke down. They gave everyone in line an exclusive express pass that included coming back to Hagrid's to cut the line which was a tremendous blessing. We also had breakdown problems at Minions and again on Hagrid's when we actually rode it (delay after the devil's snare for a brief bit that was a little terrifying as we could hear the next riders above us and were afraid they'd drop on us!).  The Universal App worked pretty well, but the wait times were rarely accurate for rides. Sometimes it was half as long as it was listed, sometimes twice as long. We went to go to Shrek and when we arrived at the line it said 25 minutes. Throughout our LONG line it continued to say that. Nearly an hour later, we finally got in. We went to Gringotts for a 20 minute line- and there was literally no wait- we climbed right in a vehicle! Mobile ordering was easy- but it doesn't save time. Paying on the universal app was sketchy and it wasn't accepted at the quick food service at CityWalk.  If Universal could improve its staffing both from a quality and quantity perspective, it would really benefit the guest experience.  We had purchased the Harry Potter package- in all, not worth the extra cost.",Universal Studios Florida
Paul S,1.0," May 26, 2021",Same old Orlando experience.,I'm literally standing in a line for the Hagrid thing that I scheduled a slot on using the app. They've packed as many people in the line as they possibly can and are harping at us (threatening to kick us out of line for having our masks off our noses so that we can breath.,Universal Studios Florida
Mandee L,5.0," May 25, 2021",Family Vacation Fun,"Universal Adventure Park was the best out of two we went to. Both were impressively clean, not to crowded & everyone enjoyed themselves. Wait times were a bit long but we expected that.",Universal Studios Florida
Kate Z,2.0," May 25, 2021","Crowded, unhelpful staff, and difficult to get food/water.","It’s no Disney, I’ll tell you that much. We just returned from a one day visit to Universal with park to park passes. We spent the two prior days at Disney and then switched hotels to Endless Summer Dockside. As a married couple, Dockside doesn’t offer king sized beds and has no sit down restaurants, but does have a cafeteria. It’s swarmed with teens and early 20s.  The early entry to Harry Potter is a racket. We got up early and waited in line for a bus, then arrived and waited shoulder to shoulder in the biggest crowd I’ve ever seen to get through security. Then we walked in and waited in another line to get access to the park. As the employee scanned my ticket, they dropped the rope and let in the masses. I asked what’s the point of arriving early if you get in at the same time as the masses and the employee told me we needed to arrive at 6am to get into the 8am early admission. Once we were in the park it was shoulder to shoulder for most of the experience (and this May 2021, still in the pandemic purportedly at limited capacity). The employees were worthless and rarely could answer questions. Went to the Leaky Caldron and asked the employee at the exit, “can I get a coffee here?”, she said no and sent me to the Hopping Pot. Waited in line and asked if Witches Brew was coffee (it’s beer), employee said go to the Leaky Caldron. Went back to the entrance of the Leaky Caldron, couldn’t get in because it was closed for a private event. Returned later as it appeared there was a short line, the employee says order your food on the mobile app while you wait. We do, and as soon as we get inside, the queue is hidden and waited an hour for food. We were upset and felt deceived that part of the queue is hidden and there’s no sign with the wait posted. It’s like they trick you into ordering to get you’re money and then you’re stuck waiting, hungry and thirsty. The food was “ok” and the staff seemed like zombies. Gringotts ride and queue was awesome. Don’t wait in line to buy a wand at Gregorovitches, or anywhere for that matter, it’s not an experience and you can literally buy the same wands everywhere, they sold them in our hotel giftshop. Get your butter beer early as the lines just get longer as the day passes. Line for Hogwarts express only gets longer to. Was 10min around 10:30-11:00. Was 45 min by noon. Diagon Alley is shaded and comfortable temp wise, but there’s no place to sit and rest, as is a complaint for all of Universal and IOA. Getting food and water was tough throughout the park, not enough quick carts with water and long lines. Hogs Meade is hot and sunny, no place to sit in shade and rest. We rode forbidden journey. Got right in with single rider. Then decided to leave for the day. Rather than wait for Howart’s, we walked through IOA. It’s sunny, no place to sit, no shade. And bad signage through US and IOA. Also, universal app is terrible compared to Disney. Tried to stop at several restaurants and get a bite to eat, hours long waits. Got to Citywalk and hours long waits. Also, bad signage. Many restaurants were closed and rather just put up a sign that no restaurants were open, we wasted energy walking. Finally gave up and left park. As we were leaving through a different park than we entered, stopped to ask security guard how to get back to hotel. He was rude unhelpful, acted like he had never heard of Endless Summer Dockside and then laughed and snarkily said, “well how’d you get here” as if I was a moron for asking. I had to explain, I’m leaving through a different park than I entered through, and just shrugged his shoulder and said, the same way you got here. FYI, the busses are the same for both parks. You walk through citywalk for both parks and then go back through security and down to where the buss dropped you. If you strictly want to ride coasters, universe might be for you. We found that the park is geared toward teens and early 20s, and is by and large and lower caliber of park goer and certainly the employees don’t even come close to the level of hospitality and helpfulness you get from Disney. We probably won’t go back unless there is a major expansion to Harry Potter. If anything, our experience made us appreciate Disney all the more.",Universal Studios Florida
Kimberly T,1.0," May 24, 2021",Parking and Guest Services TERRIBLE!!!!!!!!!!,"We went to City Walk due to being with our quadriplegic son. Nothing but CHAOS in regards to parking. No STRUCTURE whatsoever. Unfortunately, we were in the lane furthest away from the handicap accessible area so we had to make our way all the way across to see if we could park in that area. We made it across -scary though- to try to ask the young lady if we could park in that area and she shoved us away, A guy not too - he did the same thing. Actually 4 people total. So we headed on with the rest of the crowd where we were sandwiched in. We parked and had to make it work to get him out. We went to Guest Services only for this guy to say ""we are working long hours"", told us he was working from 1 to 1 and maybe one of us could stand guard while he got out. He did go on to say he was making notes in the system, etc. I called maybe a day or so later to file a complaint as I was sure this guy didn't share our concerns and I was right. When I filed the complaint via phone, I was told my concerns would be shared with management as this was an ADA issue. He gave us a $15 gift card for whenever we returned. To date no one has reached out. All it would have taken was for one of thing to take a minute or so to see what we wanted. I was so disappointed as I have been to Universal many, many times and to have my son who was tragically hit by a CAR which is why he is quadriplegic, to have to park in this deck where his parents had to act as shields was ridiculous. Sad, sad, sad.",Universal Studios Florida

SunilnRiss,5.0," May 22, 2021",Stay at one of 3 resorts that offer EXPRESS PASSES,"The park is always awesome.

My teens are 16, 17 and 19 and they cant get enough of this place.",Universal Studios Florida
Natasha L,5.0," May 19, 2021",Despite the Circumstances,"It was humid, it was windy, we had to wear masks, but Universal still didn’t disappoint. Here’s a little breakdown on what to expect:  May 18- This was a Tuesday, and we chose to go midweek due to better ticket prices and (we hoped) less of a crowd. Even in a pandemic, there are still many people who want to get out to experience some thrills, so the parks were busy. The Universal Studios park was our focus for the day, and we got there as soon as it opened. I recommend this: go as soon as it opens and immediately ride the most popular rides. There will be a shorter wait time. Gringotts was our first ride, and we only waited about 10-15 minutes. After 10:30, the parks tend to get busier and lines much longer. You do have to wear masks the entire time you are in line (even if you are standing in line outside), but you can take off your masks while walking around the park. This was really nice given the humidity. By about 11, most wait times at the Universal Studios park are about 40-60 minutes on average. Depending on the time of day, restaurants will also have longer waits. We went to Mel’s Drive-In at 11:30 with only a short wait. There is one thing to be aware of: weather. Because of high winds, Rip Ride Rocket was “delayed”. Many people were surprised by this and gave workers a hard time, but keep in mind this is for your safety.  May 19- In our opinion, if you had to choose between the parks, choose Islands of Adventure. There are more thrill rides, and rides in general. We once again got to the parks as it opened and right away only had 10 minute waits for the Hulk ride, King Kong, and Harry Potter’s Forbidden Journey. Hulk and King Kong have about 60-80 minute waits on average. Lines started to get longer after 11:00. Here’s a tip: keep an eye on the Velocicoaster... it’s set to open on June 10, but there are random limited times the public can ride it. We rode it, and it was FANTASTIC if you love rollercoasters. Easily our favorite ride. Hagrid’s Motorbike Adventure is also a great experience. Again, don’t be surprised by long restaurant waits. Our longest wait time of the entire day was to enter the Three Broomsticks to eat for lunch (about 1:30 is when we got there). Worth the wait!  All-in-all, it’s still a great (and pricy) time despite the circumstances. If you need an escape, this is worth it!  (One more thing) Unless you are a huge Fast and Furious fan or have run out of rides, I would not wait longer than 30 minutes for Supercharged in the Universal Studios park. It’s underwhelming and very short.",Universal Studios Florida

Aleisha523,1.0," May 19, 2021",Don’t buy a package with one of their partner hotels!,"So this was our first visit to Universal. We have been Disney Passholders for years but just never did Universal. That being said I guess I am used to Disney customer service and they are definitely NO Disney. Our trip was to be a two week trip with the first 7 nights spent at a Disney resort and then a 4 night stay at Universal. When I called to order tickets they told me they had a special package deal. I asked about the package but told them I wanted to stay on their property. She told me there was no availability on their property for our dates but she had a partner hotel right across the street from Universal that was available. She said they had suites with a kitchenette available for a little more so I opted for the suite. She assured me that this was a great hotel, close to the parks and that we would get all the same benefits of staying on property since it was a partner hotel and a package through them.  I looked at pictures of this hotel while on the phone with her at it looked very and clean and since Universal was selling it to me I booked it.  We had called the resort the morning we were to check in to see if we could get an early check in so we could get settled and head to City Walk for the day. We called five times and no one would answer the phone. First red flag! We got there to see if we could check in early and they said they had a suite available. The pictures I added are just a few of the disgusting room they stuck us in. When you opened the door the smell almost knocked you over. Not to mention the stains and cigarette burns all over the carpet. It was filthy, paint chipping off the walls, the furniture was peeling and chipped every where. There was a piece of cardboard with water stains covering the front of the dishwasher. It was so gross! My husband called the front desk to complain and she said she would move us to a newly renovated room. So we moved all our luggage to the “newly renovated” room only to go to a room that looked like it had not been cleaned since they renovated it. The carpets were filthy, there was a brownish stain on the grey couch that looked disgusting. The toilet paper holder was falling off the wall, we open up the sleeper sofa just to see it and it was a mattress with plastic over it, there were no extra linens in the room for the sofa bed, the bed in the room looked like someone had been on it already and we had paid extra specifically for the kitchenette ( full fridge, sink, dishwasher, little stove top and microwave). This room had a mini fridge and microwave ( I can get that at any standard hotel for much cheaper).  We decided there was no way we were going to stay there but since we paid Universal we figured they would need to fix this. We called and waited for 1 and half hours to talk to someone. She was kind but kept telling us there was nothing available on their property for our dates. I assured her at that point it didn’t need to be on their property; I just wanted a clean and decent room. She said a supervisor would have to help us but she would have to put us on hold until she could get one. Another half hour and finally a supervisor gets on. We explain the situation, how bad the hotel is and that we want a different place. After we paid them for this. He tells us it is not their fault that the hotel isn’t nice and kept asking us “what do you want me to do about it” He too was saying that they had no hotels available on their property. Again, I told him he needed to find us a different property, I don’t care where it is. He was so rude and uncaring of the situation they had put us in. I told him that we could have just stayed longer at our Disney resort and bought tickets for Universal but because there agent assured me this was a partner hotel close to the parks; I booked it. After about another half an hour on the phone with him he finally tells my husband the only way he can e en help us is if he goes down and the hotel lets us check out with a refund. So my husband agrees to do that and says “how do I call you back?” He says “I have no direct line so you can’t.” I said at one point that I found a bolted available at Disney and we would just go back there. The supervisor says “well that’s your choice” My husband said “I will keep you on the phone then while I go see if we can check out” He goes down checks out and another 15 to 20 minutes later they magically have rooms available at Endless Summer Dockside. It was after 5 by the time we got all the this settled and checked in to Dockside. Funny thing is that Dockside was a cheaper resort so we actually paid less. Also, I checked hotels.com that evening just to check and sure enough, I could have reserved a room through them for the length of our stay at Dockside. They stuck us in a terrible resort and then didn’t want to take responsibility or help us in any way. The attitude we got from the supervisor was awful. We did complain to guest services but it was City Walks guest services. He said he would send the information to Universal and we would hear from someone. It’s been a week since we checked out and we have still heard nothing. Never an apology! Clearly Universal’s guest services sucks!!",Universal Studios Florida

kanukgirl0,2.0," May 18, 2021","Money Money money, it’s. Rich mNs world","Universal studios... three theme parks 1 universal studios. A walk through the park with its many shops and. Few rides, NOT worth the price we paid. The food places are over priced, Nd very poor quality food, the City walk restaurants Re much better. In universal it cost me $9.90 for an ice cream only 2 scoops. There Re very few rides for children, a couple of adult rides. Not worth going. I paid over $730. For two people for three days at the three parks. Park 2 Adventure land? Much better, but still few kiddy rides and rides for people who dont want a roller coaster. If you like thrill rides then do this park. Food still garbage. Park 3 Volcano Bay. The best of all three. Take your own towel, unless you want to rent one for $6. Each. There Are things for older adults to do and children and thrill seekers, food is also much better and more reasonable priced. The Lazy river is the best , water 3 ft deep. Ride on an inner tube and have fun. If you are planning a trip to Universal Studios. I would recommend you skip the first park and stick to the other two. As for gift buying... dont buy anything inside the parks, go to one of the many. Bargain stores outside of the parks , you’ll get the same things as a quarter of the price. Try BENZER INTERNATIONAL INC 6454 International dr. T Shirts as low as $1.99 each I would not go back to Universal Studios. It was far to Expensive, and parking is $26 per day or $40 per day to park a little closer (. Not much closer) you still have a very long way to walk to get into the actual park... all in all Universal Studio is NOT worth it.",Universal Studios Florida

DelBueno,2.0," May 18, 2021",From bad to worse as time goes by.,"As Florida residents we've been to both universal parks many times over the years and one thing is for sure, each visit seems to have been worse than the previous one. Today, was no exception and the criticisms are plenty so let me begin: 1. Prices. Paying just shy of $800 in admission for one day for four people is plain obscene particularly when I consider what we got for that amount of money: In all, we were only able to ride SIX, got that right 6 rides despite relative low crowds. In the past we visited on days with crowds similar to today's and were able to ride almost all rides and repeat some with little waiting time but not today. Today, the parks seemed understaffed so we ended up with wait times befitting peak crowds in summer with some rides clicking a 70-minute wait. Again, and I can't stress this enough, today's attendance was light as evident by the empty parking lots. 2. Terrible organization. The ""geniuses"" running things decided to make even buying food an ordeal in itself. From 11am on we tried repeatedly to purchase drinks or food to no avail because even a simple line to buy butter beer at the harry potter side of things was a lengthy process. We were not able to drink or eat until 3pm and that, with minor children, is a big problem. One would think that in this post-pandemic times universal would have more venues open to avoid people conglomerating but no sir the ""geniuses"" think that having people line up in confined spaces for long wait times is just what we need to diminish the risks of corona virus transmission. I won't even get into the pricing for the drinks and food because that's another obscenity: $90 for four burgers and drinks is just absurd. 3. Rude staff. While most staff was cordial the fact is that the few bad apples make a more lasting impression and on that I can't avoid thinking of the two morons working at the security check point both of whom were rude, literally herding us with ""hurry up"" when we had been held back ourselves because of their own incompetence and then, there's the attendant at one of the harry potter rides who insisted in having me store my small bag (which I have used many times before at universal) while having no issue with women's purses that were significantly larger. I didn't oblige her smugness and simple placed my small bag under my shirt and not once was it an issue during the rides. So this sums up the nightmarish day our visit to universal studios and islands of adventure turned out to be. It's quite telling when children tell you that service was poor isn't it? That's what happened to us today. In the end we felt so disgusted by the whole thing that we didn't even bother staying overnight and drove back home to put some distance between us and this crappy nightmare the universal studios and islands of adventure have become. Would we recommend these two parks? Sure, if you're predisposed to being taken advantage and taken for granted.",Universal Studios Florida
Mrbucketlist,5.0," May 17, 2021",There's Disney...then THERES UNIVERSAL ORLANDO,"This has been a long time coming. I've literally been coming to this park since I was a child. After growing up, moving to florida, even working here for a year and now being an annual pass holder I can say I love this park. It's not perfect and no park is but the technology they have added in there rides are amazing!!! Now I'm personally more of a fan of Islands of adventure myself but I always visit both parks while I'm there. Yes I prefer these parks over disney just because of the ease of everything while here. Plus they have actual thrill rides, unlike Disney. Regardless all the theme parks in Florida are great. You'll enjoy it- MrBucketlist",Universal Studios Florida
TWOGTHEPUG,5.0," May 17, 2021",Consistently Magical,"I've been to Universal multiple times and have always been amazed at what they can do to make you really feel like you are in a world of magic. Harry Potter land is very impressive and fun for everyone. If you want to take your kids to the Wand Experience, go early or late so you don't run into crowds and have to wait a while and not get picked. Also, wear Harry Potter gear- they're more likely to pick you! The food is above average, but the butterbeer is a must get. All Simpsons fans MUST go to Springfield, USA. It is very well done, and the ride is hilarious. I would recommend Bumblebee man's tacos. Keep in mind that I went before the pandemic was really bad, so this might not be the current situation. Hope this helps!",Universal Studios Florida
Tenaya G,1.0," May 16, 2021",After 9 movies how did Fast & Furious miss the mark,"The Fast n Furious Supercharged ride was disappointing to say the least. The walk through the garage preparing for the ride was cool, but the actual attraction was poorly thought out as we expected the attraction to give us a ""fast n furious"" feel. Its been a whole week and I am still talking with my wife about how disappointing the ride was. Whether the ride is revamped into a roller coaster or a thrill ride, riders want to feel the speed. I envision a coaster with two tracks, sleek jet black cars for the riders, a few death-defying hills with nice drops, and a mean race to the finish line just like you see in the movie races. With all the advances made with thrill rides and simulators, I struggle to understand how this ride was put together to provide a fast n furious experience and completely missed the mark. Instead, the rider ends up constantly twisting their necks trying to keep up with a mad street race with guns and felt absolutely nothing during the ride except for a cramp in your neck from all the twisting and turning. The creators of this ride need to go back to the drawing board as this ride had the potential to elevate Universal to one of the top parks in Orlando. Instead, this ride hurt the prestige of the park. The creators need to do better as my family and I were thoroughly disappointed.",Universal Studios Florida

And paying twice to go in two connected parks is the biggest theme park rip-off ever!",Universal Studios Florida
Wendy L,2.0," May 13, 2021",Disney is so much better than Universal!,"This was only about my third trip to Universal, and the first time I stayed at one of their resorts. It was pretty disappointing. The main reason I wanted to stay at one of their resorts was so that I could get into the park an hour early. I got up and got there a little before 8, which was when the early opening started. Instead, we stood there 45 minutes until the gates opened. It turns out, if they don't have enough employees, they only open one gate (there are 2 parks). And, unfortunately, I was standing at the wrong gate. I wouldn't have minded if I'd been told this ahead of time.  Other disappointments were Cauldron Cakes -- used to be sooo much better, had been looking forward to it all day -- is now basically a cupcake in a silicone cauldron (used to have ganache and an edible chocolate handle). The app was not that great, didn't really give directions to attractions. Also, there were a lot of rides where you were required to ""debag"" and put any backpacks, etc. in a locker. While the lockers were free -- probably the only free thing in the park -- this got to be a pain.  While the hotel was nice and new (Dockside), the light right when you came in the door didn't work and the walls were thin. I collapsed around 8 PM after a fun day in the park and was awakened by the people next door coming in around 11.  I definitely prefer Disney for overall experience and especially customer service. This may be my last Universal trip.",Universal Studios Florida
jznawllms,4.0," May 12, 2021",Our first trip to Universal was outstanding!!,"We spent a week at Universal Studios at the end of April. My husband and I and our 2 teenage sons had a wonderful time. We loved the rides in both parks and the Harry Potter worlds. Our only issue was lunch in The Three Broomsticks. We had purchased the quick service dining plan along with the freestyle souvenir cup. the third day we were told that our dining plan did not cover a drink with our meal since we had the freestyle cups. There are no sodas or freestyle stations to get drinks from in Harry Potter worlds. Drinks for 4 people would cost at least 16$ and I felt like I had already paid for this drink when paying for our dining plan. I asked to speak to manager but they would not come speak to me. Sent the kid to say we could have free glasses of water. Well, duh, you can get free water anywhere in the park. Any way, I let it go but it ruined our whole dining experience there. After we got home I looked over the information on the quick service and no where does it say that by getting the freestyle cup you would not get a regular, drink with your meal. It specifically states that a non alcoholic beverage comes with your dinner. I really only included ALL of this to let people know what to expect in the Harry Potter worlds. This was a major focus of our trip and to get so upset kinda ruined the day. Every other part of our trip was outstanding. Employees were always happy to help with any questions that we had about our first trip there.",Universal Studios Florida

I agree with other reviews: STAY HOME. The parks are painful in the heat with masks, and it is not even summer sizzling yet here in Florida. Mask police with bullhorns are roaming to yell that you cannot walk and drink. Usually, one of the bars is a great refuge for adult visitors. No, denied! You need reservations to sit at a bar. Then, good luck getting through the reservation line. Toothsome Chocolate Factory especially annoying where I always visit on trips. Friend and I booted off barstools since didn’t have a reservation.

Kenneth E,1.0," May 10, 2021",Zero compassion for children,"I have a special needs child who just turned 3. He really wanted to go to Universal so we flew all the way out to Florida. When we were checking in at the front gate, the park rep started berating my 3 year old for not wearing a mask. I explained that he had sensory issues with his face and had a doctors note showing he could not wear a mask due to his medical condition. The park rep said, ""That's your problem not mine."" and kicked us out telling us we needed to go to park services. We had to wait in another 1 hour line just to get a wrist band identifying my child as special needs. This is not the way to treat people. I could tell this park rep had never had children the way he was treating us with such disrespect. I understand some people are in such fear of the pandemic but there are special needs children who have sensory issues with their face. We flew out to Florida since the governor lifted the mask mandate and figured we could have a good outdoor experience. Also, we went to Lego Land before this and had absolutely no issues. Lego land allowed kids under 8 to not wear masks. It will be hard for me to give Universal another try since the workers there have no respect for children.",Universal Studios Florida
Heather J,2.0," May 8, 2021",Family vacay,"We were disappointed because as a family of 12, 4 were under the age of 11 and unable to ride most things. We paid $145/ticket for each person, the kids area was closed down, there was a pretty severe storm that rolled through (no fault of the park obviously) and that shut down several things also. You have to buy multi day hopper pass because you can't purchase a single day, multi park ticket and thats $292 for 2 adults! Apparently we didn't research enough to know that the majority of the rides we were looking forward to, were in the Island of Adventure park, and we couldn't access them. We walked the entire park in a fairly short amount of time and half our group went back to the hotel because there was nothing for the little people to do after about 2.5 hours. The other half stayed longer to ride a few things and even at half capacity, we still had to wait 60 minutes for the Harry Potter ride which was cool, but short and not worth the wait. I couldn't imagine waiting hours for it! As typical, food was crazy expensive and just ehhh, ok, parking $26.... There was no sanitization available at the drink refill stations and everyone just kept touching the same surfaces and I never saw anyone wiping them down.

Jewel G,1.0," May 8, 2021",Reality TV theme park style,"On day one we were seriously aware that no one was enforcing the cleaning, masking or distancing restrictions. The staff at the stores in CityWalk were rude and not accommodating. The parks were ok during the week but its dirty with long chaotic lines. The only reason to go is to see Harry Potter in my opinion. My suggestion is go during the week and go early otherwise you will be packed in with hundreds of others in the heat without proper restrictions. We stayed in the last day to watch the reality tv show that was occurring hourly between patrons and staff by the pool at the hotel. Save your money and go to Disney.",Universal Studios Florida
Sarah L,5.0," May 7, 2021",Loved it,"Our family did both parks in two days during COVID, with a park hopper. We intentionally chose this time to go in the hopes of lower crowds due to reduced capacity limits. We also picked the first week of May for the same reason - hoping for slightly lower crowds.  It was our first time to Universal theme parks, and we had a great time. My kids are probably unusually adventurous and hardy (as a friend of our says, they are like little Vikings), so at 11 and 6 they both had a blast here, and found it a little more exciting than Disney (“less boring” as my 6 year old said). We did opt for the unlimited Express-pass, and we were not sure it was worth it. This could be due to the reduced capacity. Which I will say I can’t imagine these parks with 50% more people in them. I would never come here during peak season, as the parks themselves are more compact than Disney. We had the ability to child-swap with the family we came with, so all of us were able to ride most of the rides twice. So by the second day, we didn’t really want to ride anything again, which made the unlimited pass seem unnecessary. I wouldn’t come here without at least the one time express pass though, because in two days we did everything! Overall, we found the food situation a bit difficult to navigate, but I feel like once you get to know it, it made more sense. It was hard to just find food when you were hungry without excessive waits. The mobile ordering was not really intuitive, and we couldn’t get my account working to try it anyway.  Here’s what we loved about US. Diagon Ally is amazing, and we spent quite a bit of time here. There are more 3D-4D rides on this side, and we really enjoyed them, although not everyone in our party was as interested. My daughters loved the Simpsons ride and it’s pretty funny. In fact one of the things we enjoyed about Universal, was a lot of laughs, wit, humor and the sense of immersion in the movie.  Drawbacks were few, the main one being the Wand Experience, which is a hyped up sales pitch. A tip is get there during early admission if you can the first day and sign up it, then purchase the wand. After the experience we didn’t have the heart to say no to them, and ended up buying two more wands. The other disappointing thing was they only chose our oldest daughter for the show. Luckily I asked about it as they ushered us out (as I didn’t that understand going into it), and they nicely called us back in. They did a truncated version of the show for my little one, but she rolled with it. My youngest always seems to get the short end of the stick, so I was initially mortified by this, as she just wilted as we were walking out. My tip would be to let the wand master know that both kids need a wand (they did both the kids for the family we were traveling with) or ask about booking different times.",Universal Studios Florida
amway60436,3.0," May 6, 2021",Ok...,"First off most of the information given to me by Guest Services over the phone was inaccurate. The dining plan is only good within the parks according to a staff member at our resort and the refillable cups are only good in the parks as well. The freestyle cup has to be activated daily which is a major inconvenience since you have to wait in long lines just to activate a cup then go look for a station to fill it at. A staff member at our resort actually told us even though 1 of the restaurants within the resort is listed as quick service facility they don't accept the dining card and when I mentioned it to a staff member at the park she seemed surprised and said ""I guess I learned something today."" The 2 park per day ticket is only good for the theme parks which I had been told it applied to all 3 parks. If you want to go to Volcano Bay you have to purchase the 3 park ticket. The photo package was a total waste of money. Only a few rides take pics and I only saw 1 person in front of the theme park taking pics which I never got since she told me she couldn't scan my photo pass she had to give me a different card each time and I wasn't able to download them. Maybe we are a little spoiled by Disney since everything is extremely convenient with them. Everything with Universal is unorganized and wastes a ton of time. If they made everything accessible through the app it would be so much easier. The only thing good about Universal is they keep the ride lines moving and the wait is not that long at all but summertime may be different.",Universal Studios Florida

They refused to answer questions just said 'we had to have a tablet' and to 'go away' . We found a more personable wizard the next day and he explained that we had to be there very early (and we had early admission and got there asap) and did not give us much hope.

Kathy E,3.0," May 6, 2021",Universal - too hot for masks,"My husband and I visited Universal a couple years ago and had a fantastic time. This trip didn’t meet those expectations. The rides IF/WHEN you got to them met our expectations. Several were closed for most of the day. Temps hit 95 all days we were there. You were forced to wear a mask all the time except when you were “actively eating or drinking in a stationary spot.” The Express Passes ruined our visit. I get it the Express People paid extra, but there needs to be limits to give the Gen Pop a fair chance at the rides. A 25 min wait at the train turned into a 70 min wait in the hot dungeon with our faces covered. People were dropping from the heat.  Places to eat and drink experiences long, slow, never-ending lines of people waiting in the sun. Since our last visit, Universal has added two huge hotels and two new, modern rollercoasters, but no new places to get food and drink. The park has limited infrastructure and the visitors needs need to be addressed too.  We stayed at Endless Summer hotel which was very nice, but the lobby stayed warm due to all the people. (It was only 1/2 full too.) Pier 8 offered some reasonably priced food items. Some items we wish we could have used, but we had no microwave in our room. :.( Staff members were friendly and courteous. We also had to buy coffee in the park since we don’t drink Starbucks and we also didn’t have a coffee maker in our room.  We chose this time because school was still in session. Ha!

We had a stroller even if my daughter is way too old to use it on a daily basis, but it was awesome to be able to carry stuff all over the park. We didn't have to wait in line for food as we packed sandwiches and snacks; - skip the shops and buy souvenirs outside the park if you want to save money and wait lines; - skip the VIP parking; -wr hated the Virtual line system for the Hagrid ride. We couldn't get on despite trying for two days. They should just allow standby lines in addition to virtual lines to avoid so many frustrated people clicking insanely on their phones; -skip the Pterodactyl ride if the line is more than 20 minutes. It's so short it's not worth it; -must do for us: HP escape from Gringotts, HP journey, Transformers 3D, The Mummy, Jurassic river adventure, Hulk rollercoaster, Tycoon Lagoon...

Disney has no issues with there system. The food service is even worse recieved 2 burgers with hair in it. Didn't get our drinks till 20mins after we received the food. We and several other families were told with an attitude that they are behind on drinks! You expect me to believe it's harder to pour soda then make a burger. For 400$ we got to go on 2rides.

Casey H,1.0," April 28, 2021",Not worth the stress or the money. Go to Disney instead.,"TLDR; They don’t observe or enforce Covid safety precautions and the limited park hours and long wait times make the trip a waste of time and money.  We went on April 26th and as soon as we walked up to the entrance, it was chaos. I wish I had taken a photo because I hadn’t seen a crowd like this since before Covid. I was shoulder to shoulder with unmasked strangers and did not see a single Universal employee in sight until we were at the main entrance to City Walk getting our temperature checked. At that point, the poor women checking temperatures were screaming at people to form a line. Everything in me was telling me to turn around and just ask for a refund, but I hoped it would get better once we got into the park.  Trying to get into the park wasn’t any easier, there were no guides to show us where to go and things were extremely backed up.  Once in the park, we figured we’d wait until wait times for Harry Potter rides went down and decided to ride some of the rides closer to the front of the park. The first line we get into was stress-inducing and made me want to leave right away. We begged people to observe the markings on the ground and keep a safe distance from us, but it wasn’t happening. People were taking their masks off in line when Universal employees were out of site (which I rarely even saw employees anyway) and even eating in line. We were unable to distance from the people in the lines to the left and right of where we stood and much preferred Disney’s plexiglass shields in these situations to Universals lack of dividers. It was loud (even for a musician that is hard of hearing) and the people in line with us were obnoxious and rude.  The whole reason we came to Universal was for Wizarding World of Harry Potter, but wait times were always over 75 minutes (or higher) and the Harry Potter parts of the park were always over crowded that we decided to keep our distance. It’s obvious they weren’t limited capacity. Everywhere we went, we were dodging people and trying to distance ourselves from others with no luck or reciprocated efforts.  After riding ONE Harry Potter ride (and not even the one we wanted to ride), we ended our day early and literally ran to the car to get out as fast as we could. Our experience was not worth the money for the ticket or the stress we endured throughout the park.  Honestly, we were shocked. Our experiences at the Disney parks were incredible as the staff went above and beyond to make sure Covid safety precautions were being followed and enforced. We never felt uncomfortable and rode every ride we wanted in every park with wait times under 45 minutes.",Universal Studios Florida

Melanie,1.0," April 26, 2021",SAVE YOUR MONEY,"I would highly recommend NOT visiting during Covid. Our experience this morning was horrific. There weren’t any staff anywhere guiding people as they parked, no clear line markers or barricades for lines, masses of people with no social distancing, only 3 people taking temperatures, nothing was contactless w with sec urity or check in, no notable capacity limit. After spending 3 days at Disney where everything was seamless & easy to navigate, this is a nightmare. And all the Harry Potter stuff is closed this morning.",Universal Studios Florida
bdutra,5.0," April 25, 2021",First Time Visit,"Enjoyed all rides that I went on.  Tip: bring ear plugs for noisy rides, noisy queues and noisy walk ways around the park  Tip: Bring rain gear or cheap ponchos.  Went during the Mardi Gras extended celebration and got the 15 taster pass and enjoyed all the different food. Portions are samplers size so not sure the ala carte pricing is worth it but the pass makes it affordable.  I do not recommend the Jurassic park cafe that sever the smoked turkey legs, etc.  Also a bummer to never get a virtual line confirmation for hagrid's ride. Think our last day the line was open to everyone but virtual line seems to be a joke  If Universal is reading this, have more than 1 person at the photo stations to help find the riders for popular rides and/or invest in better technology to find the riders.",Universal Studios Florida
John L,1.0," April 24, 2021",Universal Studios Orlando Rip Off,Too many people were let into the park the day I visited Wednesday April 21st. I didn’t think a Wednesday in the middle of April would be packed but Universal offers special passes to Florida residents which makes the situation worse. The park was miserable because of the long wait times. Too many gift shops and restaurants and not enough rides. Three of the rides had to stop at different times because of technical difficulties and a 4th ride had to completely shut down after we wait in line for 30 minutes. This is the worse theme park I have ever been to. We paid around $170 per ticket to visit both small parks which should be one big one. Then we couldn’t really ride more than a couple of popular rides all day long because of excruciating wait times. I was going to buy an express pass for $67 the quote online from Universal’s website but the lady said because of the number of people in the park they would be $240. Omfg so a family of four costs around 700 to visit and express passes for just one park would be $960. It would be $1660 for a family of four just to have an enjoyable experience at the park not including the outrageous food or parking costs. Save yourself and read my review...maybe you won’t make my mistake.,Universal Studios Florida
Tegan T,4.0," April 24, 2021",Good but could use improvements,I enjoy universal for what it is..it’s definitely not Disney. Harry Potter is by far the shining gem of the park. I have three suggestions- 1. Fix the Hogwarts ride. It needs to be a bit smoother. It tilts you on your back for too long creating nausea due to stomach acid rising. The screen itself seems a bit burly. It should be the best ride due to it being in hogwarts instead it’s the worst ride in all of universal but the queue is incredible. They should really look to the flight of passage for inspiration here... 2. Let adults ride on the Pterodactyl hang glider ride even if they don’t have kids. There isn’t one ride at Disney that adults can’t ride...you charge the same amount for tickets...step up 3. I think it would be really cool if there is room for this at hogwarts- a sit down nicer meal in the dining hall. When you get a reservation you could get digitally “sorted” into a house and you would sit in that section in the dining hall. Or perhaps universal could build a hogwarts hotel like Disney is doing with Star Wars and that could be a part of the experience.  Overall I enjoy universal. I do enjoy Disney more but universal has Harry Potter so...I visit them both.  I would love to see universal expand their parks and even creat a more immersive experience in other areas of the park as they have done so well with Harry Potter.  I will that that whoever designed Hagrids motorbike ride... amazing job. It’s truly the BEST ride I ever have rode in any park. The way I describe it to people is ... it’s more intense than a Disney rollercoaster but not so intense that you don’t have fun. It’s perfect. That ride is truly the most perfect formula for a rollercoaster!  Excited about the future!,Universal Studios Florida
GJPRUD,3.0," April 24, 2021","Long Lines and hurdles to get in, Long lines on Park rides (get express)","Wait in long lines everywhere. Ok so there is a lot of hurdles at the parks and it takes you more than 1 hour to just get in the door. They have added a metal detector and they take temperatures as well. (Maybe use temperature screening camera's to speed things up?) In addition, their software at the park to allow people to enter the park is less than satisfactory. You must give them your fingerprint, and it takes 30 seconds per person to just scan a ticket and get in the doors. (another long and slow moving line) To pick up tickets at Will Call 50% of machines did not work (another line).  Notes for their mgt...fix the terrible IT infrastructure, and you don't need my fingerprint!",Universal Studios Florida
TangoNY,5.0," April 24, 2021",Excellent Park! Family Fun!,We had a very good time while visiting Universal Studios! The only drawback is long lines any time of the day... lots of people even on weekdays. Express pass costs $200 per person which would put $800 dent in our budget for 4 people just for a day... that was unreasonable. So we just stood in line... Harry Potter town and a ride was the most interesting in my opinion. Universal did an amazing job with Harry Potter section! Very worth visiting! We highly recommend it.,Universal Studios Florida

We did that three times! And it was fantastic. Stayed at our time share about 20 minutes away. Employees were incredible! Hand sanitizer everywhere and on every ride! Park was so clean!

652mjb,1.0," April 22, 2021",Terrible experience,"1. Website showed limited capacity yet people were on top of each other in both parks. So crowded. Forget social distancing. 2. Many people were not wearing masks properly or at all, yet staff walking by didn't say anything. One woman became verbally aggressive when she heard my comment about everyone needing to wear masks. 3. It's so expensive for a family to visit Universal. Having to pay for 2 parks just because park has 2 sections. Disney parks added on but don't charge separate admission. 4. We started with 2 express passes for oldest kid and my husband, but quickly realized we'd be waiting 1.5 hours each ride so bought 3 more express passes. Yet still had to wait almost an hour at many rides with express passes! 5. Food places were insanely crowded and expensive. $15 for a turkey leg that was dried out and awful. Cupcake was hard and stale. 6. We bought tickets online yet no info that hagrid's ride sells out early. I knew we couldn't use fast pass, but had no idea we couldn't wait in line for the ride as it sold out after noon. 7. No signs, no maps. 8. We paid for preferred parking, yet they made us walk back to general parking lines to go thru security. 9. I will never go back to Universal Studios in FL again. This is my 3rd trip to it, but this time was insanely expensive - almost $3000 just for park tickets and express passes. I could've gone on another trip to Disney! Disney is doing it well with keeping people masked up and socially distant and still having fun time! Universal Studios is so overrated!",Universal Studios Florida
Elena B,5.0," April 20, 2021",Magical Memories,"We spent 3 days at Universal Studios to begin our spring break. Our expectations were uncertain due to the vastly different reviews but we took the negative ones with a grain of salt and we are so glad that we did. Yes, there is a slew of people in the park. Yes, they have varying degrees of adherence to the rules. BUT the staff works so hard to strike the balance of regularly reminding guests of the safety measures and allowing guests to immerse themselves in the experience. Even during this busy time of year, lines were not too terrible and while intially lines for food were quite long we stumbled into online ordering which was not even a fraction of the regular wait time. For that reason alone....download the app! We were able to get on all the rides with exception of Haggrids which was a digital line and never opened up for us on the app. We also could no secure any reservations in the restaurants, so learn from our fail and try to book those in advance. I was very intimidated about the wait in line to wait in line concept (aka the screening before entry), that was worthless worries....the process was very smooth and moved much quicker than I could've ever anticipated. That all said, it is what you make it.....my 17 and 10 year old years had such a wonderful time and despite the COVID circumstances we all find ourselves in, we still found the magic in the park. The staff was friendly and we had a great time! So happy that the park was open, we were able to get tickets and our family had the experience before my oldest graduates and moves onto other life adventures.",Universal Studios Florida
ShayT,5.0," April 18, 2021",Spring Break,"My family and I went to Universal Studios during our Spring Break. We purchased a 3 day 3 park ticket, and it made our trip very enjoyable. The Universal App helped us navigate which rides had the shortest waits, so we parked hop based on these times. Being able to use the 3 days within a 6 day time frame made our trip more restful. There were 2 days we walked over 20,000 steps. This was our first theme park visit since my 11 year old was diagnosed with Type I diabetes. He has to travel with a bag of medicine and supplies. All the ride attendees were very accommodating to us and helped us store his supplies prior to getting on the rides. I can’t thank y’all enough! We were very impressed and appreciate your help. My favorite ride was the Harry Potter train. I’ve read all of the books, and it was surreal to experience this ride. They did an incredible job making the books come to life. This area is extremely crowded. I would like to go back at a less busy time and have time to more time to enjoy.",Universal Studios Florida

Some rides were jam packed while others loaded to 1/3 full. Surly and unhelpful staff ( when you can find them.) Few tables or benches that aren’t in direct Florida sun. No maps aside from one stand at the main entrance and almost no signs. I had my heart set on the Hagred ride and couldn’t get a place in the virtual line all day. Every ride ends at a gift shop. They wouldn’t let me buy a meal in Jurassic park without giving my email and phone and I was deluged with spam by days’ end. Just badly done.

Curtis T,1.0," April 15, 2021",Horrible - Buyer Beware - Wait Times Ridic!!!,"I'm an amusement park fan. This was the worst experience of my life! 4 Major Points: 1) Locked out 2) Wait Times 3) Customer Service 4) Ride Shut Downs 5) Locker Fees  1) Locked out of Volcano Bay even though we arrived at 8:00 AM! Universal Oversold their parks. We bought a 3 Day - Park to Park pass. We were told by Guest Services that if we got inside Universal Studios or Islands of Adventure, we would be counted in the capacity count for Volcano Bay. My family went to U.Studios at 8:00 AM. We road a couple of rides then walked to the shuttle bus to go to Volcano Bay at 9:30 AM. The Bus Police asked to see our tickets. We were not allowed on the bus because Volcano Bay was at capacity the moment it opened at 10:00 AM!!! Universal states if you are in any one of their parks, you will be included in the capacity numbers. The Bus Police said they would ONLY ALLOW Single Day Volcano Bay Ticket holders on the bus. Universal never explains that Single Day Ticket Holders have preferential treatment or status vs Multi-Day Park To Park Hopper. We paid extra for Park to Park Hopping. I went to guest services and they told me the same thing. ""Sorry, Single Day Ticket holders are guaranteed admission and my 3 day Park to Park doesn't guarantee me admission."" We spent $2,700 and could never get to the water park. Universal suggests getting to the park early as the park may reach capacity. Volcano Bay reached capacity right at 10:00 AM when it opened. There were people waiting at the gate who were turned away at 10:00 AM. You can't get to the park any earlier if it reaches capacity before it opens people.  2) Wait Times - Ridiculous even with Virtual Line Pass. Our family had the App open and could only snag 1 time for Hagrid's. The line was so long, we waited 110 minutes! That's almost 2 hours long even with Virtual Line Pass! No 2 Min 50-second ride is worth almost 2 hours waiting in line! We averaged 7 rides each day. Totally not worth it! So many lines that were 45-90 minutes wait times.  3) After several families almost revolted over the Volcano Bay debacle, one of the guest services individuals gave me the Guest Services contact phone number (407) - 224-4233 to voice my complaint. This Guest Services number doesn't allow you to talk with a real person about any complaints!!!  4) Ride Shut Downs and inaccurate wait time postings. A) Waited 40 minutes for MIB and it shut down. B) Waited 30 minutes for Rip Rocket and it shut down C) Waited 15 minutes for Minions but left line because of delay  5) All the $2.00 locker fees add up!!! Beware!  Never Going Back! I can go to Cedar Point, Six-Flags, and King's Island to obtain greater value for the money spent at Universal.",Universal Studios Florida
Portlandmama,4.0," April 14, 2021",Great trip,I think JK Rowling saved Universal. My daughter who is a huge Potter fan wanted to go for the HP worlds and that is all we did. The rest of the parks we both had no interested in waiting in long lines for 3-D rides. If you only go to one park though and don't care too much about rides Universal's Diagon Alley has more to offer than Hogsmead. The gringots ride though is a lot scarier than we thought it would be though. I guess we should have figured with all the warning about not to ride if you have high blood pressure! The park was crowded though everyone was wearing masks. We didn't get yelled at if we were having a sip of water or taking a break sitting down without our masks on like I have heard in some reviews. They have learned from Disney in that the staff are like cast members and anything they talk about it's like they are really in Hogwarts.,Universal Studios Florida
Curtis W,2.0," April 12, 2021",If you are wanting to ride the major attractions...read this.,"Let me begin by saying my wife and I love US. But, the whole idea of virtual lines, and only opening certain times throughout the day, is a major problem.  US has implemented a procedure of designating times (11:00, 2:00, 4:00) when a virtual line will open up for certain rides, including the major attractions like Hagrids... The problem is that at the stroke of the hour, the lines are already full. We attempted, for four days, to get a place in a virtual line to ride this ride. After spending thousands of dollars on a vacation, researching, reading, and watching several videos on the new ride, we were excited to finally experience this world class ride, but to no avail.  When we were watching our phones changes to the hour, we were forced to continually ""refresh"" our request to secure a spot in the virtual line. Literally, we were hitting refresh as fast as we could, yet, we were not able to get a spot. When the screen changed a couple of times for us to select a time slot, we thought we made it in only to find out when we submitted our time that those times were already full. Just an insane system.  I understand if this was done to avoid standing in lines due to Covid, which is why I gave it two out of five stars. But if this is the new way of standing in lines, only the quick fingers will ever make it on a world class ride, especially in a park that is as popular as US.",Universal Studios Florida

Lots of love from Linda!",Universal Studios Florida
Christine S,3.0," April 11, 2021",COVID Protocols Inconsistent,"We took an Uber from the hotel, and that was easygoing since we were dropped off at a parking garage. No walking in the heat until we got to the main entrance where our personal belongings were scanned through a security check point. No temperature checks!!!! We visited on a Friday.  We had mobile etickets. It was easy to show and go. No need to wait in line when we first arrived at 3 pm. Pleasant weather with a nice breeze in April.  There are 2 important things you must know prior to purchasing tickets:  1) The former Harry Potter rides (Hogwarts Castle and the Hippogriff) are located at The Islands of Adventure. Thankfully, we've been there twice since Harry Potter was introduced to Orlando. The latest and greatest ride in Diagon Alley is the Gringotts Bank Vault Ride. Both Diagon Alley and Gringotts Bank ride are situated at Universal Studios. If you want to ride the Hogmead Train at Kings Crossing, you will need to purchase tickets to both The Islands of Adventure and Universal Studios. It's a 4 minute train ride! Please keep that in mind.  2) Unless you have an Express Pass, you must expect long wait times. All the rides will not have all the seats filled. For example, if the seat row has 4 seats total staff will only allow 2 people per row. If you have an even number of people in your party, you can have a partner sitting next to you. If you have a odd number, there's going to be a member going solo. Some lines entering rides will have a 6 foot distancing between families/parties while others do not. I'm not sure why this happened. Gringotts are people packed like sardines inside the bank while Shrek had people incredibly spaced out in line.  What I was disappointed with is that there were not alot of benches and seats! However, there were alot of tables set up everywhere the eye could see. Most of them were ""bar/pub"" style tables where you stand up and eat. It's not my favorite way to enjoy delicious but expensive food but pleased that the tall tables were spaced 6 feet apart.  Also, i was disappointed that there were not many sanitizer stations near food vendors. There were numerous sanitizer stations in and near gift shops, in attractions, and in stationary exhibits. I feel it's important to have sanitizer stations in all entrances to restaurants and food vendors. Even in restaurants, hand sanitizer, was few and far between.",Universal Studios Florida
Lance H,2.0," April 11, 2021",Rude Manager,"So I’ve always loved Universal Studios and I took my wife yesterday 4/10/21 for her first time and she is pregnant so she couldn’t ride any rides but she was able to wait in line with me, except for the last ride of our day which was the Hulk Coaster. I waited well over an hour to only find out that the ride has temporarily suspended operations due to inclement weather. About 20 minutes passed and here comes my wife with one of the employees just to check on me and thank God because I was getting worried about her but I was so close to the front of the line and wanted to wait a little while to see what happens, so that put me in a dilemma. The employee let her stay with me and then about 10 minutes later, Ashley, one of the managers came and told my wife she had to “get out of her line”, with such a rude attitude about it. We told her the situation and she knew about it but still said she could not stay with me. I was pretty ticked off at the way she was talking to us. I know she was doing her job but there definitely is a better way to handle a situation and that was not it. After waiting an hour and half I ended up getting out of line with my wife mainly because I did NOT like the way we were just treated. It killed my mood from the whole day and that’s just not right. Universal, you really should train your employees and managers on people skills. I would like for you to resolve this matter by actually talking to Ashley about this because that attitude was highly unprofessional and unacceptable.",Universal Studios Florida

We knew going the first week in April we would be dealing with crowds and extended wait times, however what we experienced in the parks was absolute chaos.  Aside from the initial temperature check, their enforcement of social distancing and mask wearing was a joke.  Bring your own hand sanitizer and something to wipe off tables. Plan on everything taking 3 times longer than what you expected.  If you're expecting limited capacity.... think again.  I witnessed a woman pass out cold in a line. We screamed and yelled for help, there was not a staff member within ear shot, it took over 10 minutes for someone to come to assist her.  I'll never go back.

shezwhitey,3.0," April 9, 2021",Good but will be our last time,"This will probably be our last time to Universal. We have been here several times before. We like the rides and this time was no exception. However we had some problems. I am going to mix a little advice into this review in hopes that it helps others have a better time and Universal to think about a few things.  First, get park to park tickets and give yourself at least 2 days to enjoy the rides and different aspects of the parks. Second, get express passes. You will either need to purchase them or you will get them included if you stay at one of the 3 on-park exclusive hotels that include them. This time we stayed at the HardRock. Without express passes you will not have a good time. Third, get to the park early at least one day so you have time to relax in the afternoon at your hotel pool. Fourth, if you are going to eat at a restaurant in the City Walk you should make reservations 3-4 weeks in advance. Fifth, best lunch by far was the Thunder Falls Terrace in Islands of Adventure. We got the chicken rice bowls. Great flavors and it is basically the same cost as a hotdog and chips and we did not need to wait an hour for our food. Sixth, skip Fast & Furious - Supercharged!!!!  We stayed at the HardRock which I mentioned above. We stayed 2 nights 3 days. That meant we got express passes for 3 days. That is the best part! We arrived Tuesday March 30th and left Thursday April 1st. Tuesday and Wednesday seemed a little less crowded. Thursday was very busy. As park hotel guests we do not need to wait in the standby line. We can get in early, leave, and get back into the parks without any wait. Express Passes meant we were able to ride a lot and usually waited 15 minutes or less in line. However, it seemed that express passes got poor treatment at The Mummy. We were not happy about that but there were plenty of other rides.  Hagrid's is a great ride but it is Virtual Line pass only. Express does not work for that ride and that ride alone. As hotel park guests we get early park entry and you can get in a standard line for Hagrid's. They closed that line at 8am and then it went virtual line only. The virtual line experience is total crap. It is one of the big reasons we will not be back. We had 4 people with smart phones and checked at very specific times for extra ride slots and out of 3 days we got one extra ride.  Social distancing is not enforced and there were too many people let in to the parks. Mask wearing was actually very good and the park employees were very good about reminding people to wear masks and how to actually wear them.  Universal... first, what were you thinking with the Fast & Furious ride? It is the worst ride / virtual ride and if we didn't have express passes this review would have been far worse. Second, people should not need to wait an hour in line to order food and then for it to take another hour for that food to be ready. There were lines at every place to order drink or food. If you are going to let so many people into the park you need to make sure that you have enough food and beverage stations available.",Universal Studios Florida

GoBlue,4.0," April 9, 2021",First time to universal studios,The park is a bit overwhelming for a first timer and very chaotic! That being said I was there at a very busy time of year spring break still in full swing! We did not do everything as lines where long and we didn’t care to be at the parks till all hours of night. The transformers ride was great my child liked the mummy ride also! There was a woody wood pecker land for smaller children we just walked through. We did the classic ET ride very nice nostalgic piece. Now Diagon Ally or however you say it was amazingly themed the escape from greengots ride was great! This section of the park was not Chaotically themed but very busy with people rightly so it was universals crowned jewel for sure. Overall I will be back someday.

Isabella D,1.0," April 8, 2021","Do your research, mostly unpleasant.","I was really unhappy with our day at Universal. The park was dirty, the employees were mostly unkind, social distancing was not encouraged or enforced and the park was packed to the brim. This was in March of 2021. It is hard to find somewhere to sit. All of their popular rides require you to enter into a virtual queue early in the morning. Something else our party did not know was that you cannot ride on basically any ride with your personal belongings. For rides like the Hulk, this makes sense to me. But a ride like Men in Black?? It would not have been a big deal EXCEPT my boyfriend had a backpack that does not fit in their free lockers. So we paid $2 for a bigger locker. Basically it felt like we were paying $2 to ride rides at a park we paid $200 to be at already. Mind you, we rode almost every ride in all four Disney parks this same week. Not once was his backpack an issue at Disney. We really do not care for Universal after this and we would all recommend Disney 10x over Universal for a pleasant, clean, FUN experience. Universal was not fun for us at all.",Universal Studios Florida

Purchased tickets before entering park. Had to go into a stand by entry line for 3 hrs. Park said they were at max capacity. Which when we finally got our turn to go in they were limiting entry to 12 people every 5 mins. Shouldn't have had to pay full price for 2/3rds of a day,Universal Studios Florida
dacatlanta,1.0," April 7, 2021",Save yourself the agony and go elsewhere,"Absolutely horrible experience- Universal should be ashamed of themselves for overselling tickets. Volcano Bay(which opens to the general public at 10 am) was already at capacity at 9:30 am !!! By the time we tried to go to one of the other parks instead, they were at capacity too!!! We work hard to afford a vacation and now it is ruined. Save yourself the pain and stay FAR away from Universal. We will never be back sadly.",Universal Studios Florida

Jessica H,1.0," April 7, 2021",Don't waste your money,"Universal is complete crap, very dirty, not safe, no places to sit, no social distancing, no hand sanitizer, 2-3 hour waits for one ride, just complete garbage. They say they're limiting people in the park but that's a lie, they're not regulating the covid safety measures that they keep screaming in your ear on the overhead. We got to ride 2 rides in 8 hours time, waits for food were ridiculous. People were passing out due to lack of access to water and rest areas. Just garbage, spend your money at Disney instead, way more worth it.",Universal Studios Florida
KandiceLK_12,4.0," April 6, 2021",A fun Spring Break,"Had a great time during Spring Break with my sons - ages 11 and 9. We stayed at the Loews Royal Pacific Hotel for 2 reasons - the Jurassic Park suite (super cute) and the express passes. We did the 3 park, 4 day pass, but with the express tickets you could probably do everything in 2 really full days.  Loews Royal Pacific Hotel: We arrived around 1:30 pm after taking the Universal Shuttle from the airport. We actually rode in a tour bus and the driver told us about the area and did some trivia with us. I would do that again. Luckily when we arrived, our room was ready so we could go right to our room. I booked the Jurassic Park suite as a surprise to my kids and they loved it. I enjoyed having my separate space. We were on the ground level so cell reception wasn't the greatest, but the free wi-fi worked well. Despite the Jurassic Park room, the hotel wasn't overly kid friendly with the styling and pool. I expected there to be some slides into the pool or something, but it was just a large pool. They did have a kids area with some water spraying - my sons only played there about 5 minutes. We ordered food from Jake's American Bar and ate it in our room (I wasn't impressed with the in room dining menu). The food was fine - not overly impressive. Another night we had dinner by the pool at the Bula Bar and Grill - I really enjoyed their food, especially the nachos. Our server was really attentive as well. I would have eaten there again had we had time. The other wonderful feature at the hotel was they had an Avis car rental directly in the lobby. They brought the car to the front of the hotel so the convenience couldn't be beat. Each morning - they checked your temperature and gave you a wristband. This way you didn't have to do it at park security. We also took advantage of the water taxi coming back from the parks on two occasions. That is a really nice feature and the wait was never too long for a boat. The last day it was not in operation due to the weather - I guess the water was too choppy (that was too bad because our feet were tired at the end of the week). The signs around the resort were helpful and very clear. It was easy to know which way to go, like to the bus for Volcano Bay.  Volcano Bay: In theory, they have a great system but there are kinks that need to be worked out. They give you this Tapu Tapu band where you can reserve a time for a water slide, but you can only do one attraction at a time. So if one has a 120 minute wait, you can't do any other water slides during that time that also would require a return time. While there are other things you can do while you wait - like the lazy river, adventure river, and wave pool, it doesn't make sense that you couldn't at least have 2 slide reservations at a time. Waiting 120 minutes between slides is crazy. Also - just because it says 120 minutes when you reserve your time, doesn't mean that is the actual time. My sons and I tapped at the same time. When we got to 60 minutes, 40 minutes was added back to their time but mine stayed the same. I asked a staff member about it and they said it would sync back - the system was just trying to handle over 400 people at a time. It did eventually sync back - by adding 40 minutes to my time. When it got back to 60 minutes again, I began tracking it against my watch and while the Tapu incremented in 5 minute intervals, it did not match 5 minutes on the watch. It could take 10 or so minutes to go down by 5 minutes. So your 120 minute wait could actually be a lot more. We were waiting to do the water coaster and it kept extending our day (and again, we couldn't do any other water slides during that time). I again asked a staff member and they said that at times when there are delays or system issues, time is added. I get a few minutes, but not the additional hour we had to wait. My son's Tapu came off on one of the water slides and we had to get a replacement and it wasn't clear where to get it from - we got different answers from various staff members. I did like that you could link a Tapu to your credit card via the app so that you didn't have to carry money when buying food, etc. The only other complaint I have is that the park was somewhat confusing - it was hard finding the various attractions' tapu sites and then entrances. Also, some slides allowed water shoes and others didn't. The main saving grace of Volcano Bay was the adventure river - you get a life jacket and get into a more rapid lazy river. It was a lot of fun and we spent quite a bit of our wait time in there since they didn't limit how many times you could go around.  City Walk - we didn't spend much time here since we aren't really into shopping and many of the food places were ones we could get locally or had been to other places. We did go to the Chocolate Emporium for dessert - that was great. This is also where you get the water taxi.  Universal Studios - we took advantage of the early entrance and did the Minion Ride and Harry Potter ride first thing. They had a Mardi Gras theme going on while we were there and my son enjoyed catching beads from all of the floats. We didn't take advantage of those food carts because my sons aren't adventurous eaters. I love the decorations in Universal Studios - there are so many picture opportunities and it's just really well done. Due to COVID, we did have to wear our mask but we took frequent stationary drink breaks to get some relief. Luckily it wasn't too hot on our visit- I'm sure on hotter days, it is very difficult to wear. We used the Express Pass to our advantage over the several days we were there. It makes such a difference in how much you can see and do while there. The rides are great, but I can't see standing in line an hour or so for a 2 minute attraction. The one area where the Express Pass failed was the Hogwarts Express - that line was extremely long and it didn't seem to make much difference to have the pass, there was still a long queue line. The locker areas throughout the park could get crowded at times so they easily adjusted and said only one person per party in the locker area - that helped quite a bit. The Harry Potter area was very tight - and my kids couldn't take full advantage of the wands I bought them which is too bad. Men in Black is still one of my favorite rides and we rode that multiple times until we reached Galaxy Defender title. The food lines were extremely long - we waited 45 minutes for lunch in the Simpsons area - there were plenty of empty tables so I questioned why the wait. The greeter said the restaurant wasn't staffed for the number of tables they had. The food was fine though - standard park fare, definitely seemed on the high side for price when compared to other amusement parks. I really liked the mobile ordering and payment - that way we could be seated while we ordered and paid rather than standing in a queue. There were workers throughout the park reminding people to wear their masks fully and they had people wiping down railings, etc. I liked that they gave hand sanitizer to everyone before they got on the ride. I saw them spray some rides in between people, but not everytime which I appreciated. I was at another place last summer where they sanitized every seat in between customers which made the wait extremely long. They also had hand sanitizer available after the ride for anyone that wanted it.  Islands of Adventure - we took advantage of the early entry at this park to get to the Hagrid's Motorbike ride since it doesn't take the express pass. Both times, we had to wait about 90 minutes, but that ride is definitely worth it. My kids enjoyed the butterbeer several times- make sure you check both sides of the cart, many times people were lined up in one line not realizing there was also a shorter line on the other side. The Harry Potter area was again crowded, but the kids were able to use their wands in this section. The water rides will get you wet - especially the barge one where you sit in the circular raft - we did not have a dry spot on us after that ride. We tried to use a People Dryer but it took my $5 without turning on and I could not find someone to help us with that. Luckily the sun dried us for the most part. It was too bad the shows were closed due to COVID. We enjoyed our time in this park - my sons liked that there was more variety in the type of rides in this park vs Universal Studios.",Universal Studios Florida
travelnchica,4.0," April 6, 2021","Good but, needs improvement","We flew in from California after we were vaccinated. Luckily the Mardi Gras festival was going on because the rest of the food is mediocre. The pizza line is ridiculous. Only one employee in the booth taking orders & serving. I waited over 45 minutes for pre-made & pre-sliced pizza. The worst experience was on Hogwarts express by the employee Bennie. We had express tickets & were next in line when Bennie gave us a dirty look for going up to the front gate when the blue line was apparently 6 feet back. Then part of a large party of 17 came up the elevator. He pulled them to the side, allowed more party members to go up & down the elevator & loaded them on the next train effectively allowing them to skip to the front of the line. When I questioned why, he had no valid reason. They were not VIP. Was it racism (we are Latinx)? Was it passive aggressiveness? Power trip? Did he think we were non-English speakers? Either way, his weak apology was a major miss and frustration. Also, get here early. The park was at capacity by 11:30 a.m.",Universal Studios Florida
Vacation_Commander,5.0," April 6, 2021",Universal Studios review update!,"The last time I was here and reviewed the park, was back in 2008. I felt like it was time for another visit and another review. Keep in mind that we went during Covid, so things might be a little different, but we had an absolute blast here. The kids are 11 and 8, so they were old enough to rides all of the rides, plus they had seen most of the movies that the themes were based on, so everything worked out great. Universal did a great job with mask enforcement, handing out hand sanitizer, and trying to mark lines to keep people socially distant. The fact that some people don't follow the rules isn't their fault.  Like I mentioned in my previous review, Universal does an amazing job of giving you a story to look at while you are waiting in line for a ride. So, even though we had the Express Passes, we would stop to look around at all there was to see in the ride queues. Express Passes make this place even better. You will save so much time and be able to see and do so much more if you have it. The Bourne Stunt show and the Horror Makeup show are both really fun to see. The rides here that are great are: The Mummy, Transformers, Simpsons, Men In Black, and oddly enough, the Jimmy Fallon Tonight Show ride.  Do yourself a favor and come spend a day here, it is worth it.  My only negative is it is very hard to properly enjoy the Wizarding World of Harry Potter because of the number of people that flock straight there. The parks are at a limited capacity and I still thought it was overly crowded in Diagon Alley. I can't imagine how bad it was before the limits were in place.",Universal Studios Florida
Christinah525,5.0," April 6, 2021",Amazing park,Be sure to be there SUPER EARLY (park opens at 8am) to enjoy your day. We went for spring break as expected a lot of waiting on line at 7am ( premier pass perks) . Everywhere was being cleaned and sanitized. I bought the 15 month 3 park premier passes which is totally worth it if your going on vacation to florida a few times a year. No blackout dates and parking included except the 1st parking you must pay while you get your pass. The best part of the premier pass is that you get the fast pass included after 4pm on all rides once daily. THE GREATEST FEATURE. My teenager LOVED IT. Her first time in Universal Studios. Super expensive food and souvenirs but to be expected as it is Universal. $18 for a magnet. $15 for a cup $15 lanyard $20 for a meal. It gets pricey. They do allow you to bring snacks and water.,Universal Studios Florida
Charlie J,2.0," April 5, 2021",Universal Waiting in Line All Day Studios,"The park is beautiful, clean, attentive with attentive staff. It is wonderfully decorated with great attention to detail, some of it (Harry Potter attractions, Simpson's Springfield) are visually stunning. The food inside the park was fantastic. The rides are some of the best I've ever been on (and I have had the pleasureof visiting many popular amusement parks countrywide). BUT, the lines are INSANE!!! Lines for rides were on average 2 hrs long!! Some more than that. Not just the rides, there were outrageous lines for food, shows, etc.. completely ruins the experience, and some rides you can't even get on because they shut you out if you don't get virtual pass?? You pay around $100 a ticket, so a family of 4 you are looking at $400 just to get in the door, and you spend literally half of your day standing in lines, which leads to sore feet and cranky kids! Universal needs to really get their act together and figure thus out.",Universal Studios Florida

Erica,1.0," April 5, 2021",Should have read reviews,We went on Thursday last week. I wish I would have checked reviews and saved the money. Most of the rides we did were pretty cool. No problem there. Even though the lines were ridiculous they moved pretty quickly. However most of the employees are rude. I have no problem with the mask mandates. We wore them and even managed to get one on our 4 yr old during the rides. What I have a problem with is the fact that employees will be rude to you for having your mask down while standing still and not even near another group. The girl at the Shrek ride was very rude towards my husband and myself for it on separate occasions while you had multiple other groups doing the same and nothing said about it. Another incident the employee wasn’t rude but we were waiting for the King Kong ride to be fixed away from all other groups and he came over to tell us we couldn’t vape there and had to go to a designated smoking area. I can understand if we were near other people or it was cigarettes that smell and leave litter but that’s not the case so doesn’t really make sense. Overall you are paying high prices for limited activities and to be hassled by rude employees. I wouldn’t be as aggravated if employees were taught how to handle situations more discreetly and politely.,Universal Studios Florida
Stan,3.0," April 5, 2021","Fun, but perhaps not for everyone","Keep in mind that I am 77 and have never seen most of the movies that form the canvas that this theme park is painted on. That said, the place can be very entertaining for children and teens - especially since they are immersed in the pop culture that the Hollywood studios crank out, and especially since cost is of no consequence to them. In the end, the difference in age dictates the level of enjoyment one receives from a visit here. The walking distances and the standing for hours in long lines is a game for strong healthy youngsters, it is tiring and exhausting for those of us past 55. The costs associated with a visit here are mind numbing and at every turn there are unexpected and incremental charges that one never is able to plan for. For a family of four we easily burned through a grand per day with nothing extraordinary added on. None the less, the kids were excited and devoured all the rides and exhibits and ate endless amounts of fast foods and desserts - they had not a single complaint.  I would say two days here is plenty and I would reccomend staying in one of the park hotels, it simplifies what is otherwise a complex logistical undertaking. I also would tell anyone to buy the express tickets which allows you to move through a much faster queue - you will still wait for 20-45 minutes but that is twice the speed of the general line movement.  As for social distancing, the park tries hard, but in the end the crush of humanity is unavoidable, you will be face to face with strangers on many occassions while you trek endlessly through the waiting lines. I would say I am glad I went, but it was exhausting.",Universal Studios Florida
724ernestf,1.0," April 4, 2021",Again packed...,I get it Spring Break... What I don't get is why social distancing was not a thing. Packed like sardines in most places and lines staggered when easy I'm not sure there was much planning. No rides wiped down after use and again the crowds being insane. Glad I had a vaccine.  Staff was excellent and still very nice. That's the one star here. I'm more impressed by the smaller parks in Orlando that at least wipe down the rides after every guest. It can be done.,Universal Studios Florida

7tammy,5.0," April 4, 2021",What an awesome playground!,"Our Favorite Playground! We spent three days at the park. The only downside was the distance you had to walk from the parking deck to get to the gate. It took forever! We were there last spring during Mardi Gras and were treated to a great parade. The ride lines were reasonable although COVID had just reared its ugly head when we visited. Harry Potter's World was fantastic! There just isn't anything bad to say about the park.

Jason L,3.0," April 4, 2021",Universal virtual line fiasco,First of all the park is so cool. Very well maintained. The rides we did ride were quite fun. Some negative rides were king kong and fast and furious. Lots of potential but a big let down. We absolutely loved the rocket and mummy. My biggest complaint is the virtual line. We were there for four days and tried pretty much non stop to get a spot for hagrids motorcycle ride. The easy fix would b to have both a physical line and a virtual one. Only opening up the absolute 4 tumes a day is ridiculous. U have thousands of people trying to log in virtually for a few time slots. This is totally unacceptable. The park is so expensive and to limit someone's ability to ride everything is unfair. It is now the middle of our last day and once again we are trying to get time slots for the Hagrid ride. Trying to explain that we can't ride it because there is not any times available toan 8yr old is not easy. We will probably not return until the virtual line fiasco is fixed. It makes for a very dissapointing experience.,Universal Studios Florida
GypsySoulmates,5.0," April 3, 2021",One of our favorites,"We love universal studios and islands of adventures. We go annually and always have the best time.

rtraveler2004,5.0," April 3, 2021",Out of this world theming and top quality attractions!,"This was my first visit back to Universal Orlando in 20 years with my last visit being back in 2001, before any of the Harry Potter stuff was even around. I was so glad to finally return. The park was at capacity when we arrived on the first day, but the stand by line was only about an hour to get in which went pretty quick. As long as you know how to use the virtual queue system and what rides get the longest waits at certain parts of the day, you can still ride everything within a few days. We got the 4 day park hopper tickets good for both Universal parks and Volcano Bay. If you want a ride on Hagrid's, make sure to get your reservation on the park app at 8am, 11am, 2pm, or 4pm. If you are not on there right on those times, the time slots will be gone. Hagrid's is a MUST too. Definitely one of the coolest roller coasters I have ever been on. Diagon Alley at Universal and Hogsmeade over at Islands of Adventure are linked together with the Hogwarts Express, which you will need a park hopper pass to jump between. They scan your park tickets when you get in the queue for the Hogwarts Express. Make sure to take the train BOTH ways too as it is different each way! The Harry Potter everything is...pure magical. Busy...but still very enjoyable the intricate detail to EVERYTHING will blow your mind!! The stand by lines do get long but the incredible theming in the queue lines make the waits entertaining. That and the fact that Universal does over post on most of their wait times. They do this to make people happier! An hour wait will really be about 45 minutes...or less. A 30 minute wait is usually about 15 minutes, etc. This is an amazing system that they use! Waiting to the end of the day (last hour or so) most waits will be very short. Jurassic Park is great at the end of the day too as it is the longest midday when people want to cool off. Plus it is totally different at night! Harry Potter and the Forbidden Journey is the most UNIQUE dark ride I have ever been on....by far. I won't spoil it but this is a must -do. You will find yourself staring at Hogwarts Castle due to its pure beauty. Make sure to see it all lit up at night as well. VelociCoaster looks incredible and I cannot wait to ride this. Jimmy Fallon is pretty cool although I am still salty they replaced the classic Twister attraction with this. Men in Black Alien Attack was a blast...no pun intended! Loved getting spun around shooting at the aliens competing for the highest score. The Simpsons ride was pretty cool, although may eventually need updated. The Mummy Returns has a virtual queue option so utilize this if there are time slots available. E.T is always great! Rip Ride RockIt is fun but choose your song quick as I was not fast enough so it chose for me as we approached the lift hill. The Hulk, Spiderman, and Reign of Kong over at Islands of Adventure are all fantastic! Make sure to eat at the Three Broomsticks in Hogsmeade too. The line was wrapped all the way around and to the back but we still got seated within about 30 minutes. Pretty much all the Universal restaurants require mobile ordering where you order and pay on your phone via the Universal app and they bring your food out and you take it off the trays. This eliminates any touching. Masks are still required in the parks but hopefully with vaccines rolling out, this mandate won't be around much longer. Parking does take awhile, but once you're through the toll booths, it clears up and you are parked pretty quick. Make sure to note what section you parked in. Another absolute MUST is to watch the end of the day ""Celebrations"" waterfront show at 9:45pm. This is a high energy fountain show mixed with fireworks and projections all around you that bring you right into the movies. It was absolutely incredible!! I definitely will not let it be another 20 years before I return to Universal Orlando. It was a fantastic 4 days!",Universal Studios Florida
Susan C,1.0," April 3, 2021",Don’t go to Universal Studios,"The workers were rude and spent the entire day yelling at the few people whose masks fell below their noses instead of actually doing their jobs. I never saw any of them cleaning. Wait times for food were much longer than ever in the past. The park didn’t seem any less crowded than usual. Their covid measures seemed to only entail lazily yelling at guests all day. Most people really had masks on appropriately and the policing was unnecessary. The rides were also ruined with them constantly calling out over the actual sound provided for the ride to remind people about masks. They even reminded guests who had masks on appropriately. It was crazy. They need to remember that some guests may require a break with all the walking to catch their breath, especially older guests. How did they know whether or not some of the people they were yelling at had medical conditions. I was shocked at the way people around me were treated.",Universal Studios Florida
mommiesRN,4.0," April 3, 2021","Great Experience, recommend the express pass!","We spent one day at Universal and Islands of Adventure with the park to park tickets. 2 adults and 2 kids age 11 and 8. We stayed one night at Hard Rock Hotel, which included the Express Passes and despite the high price they were worth EVERY PENNY! As expected, the parks were packed because of it being spring break season. We never would’ve been able to ride all that we did without the Express Passes. We had early access due to staying on Universal property and went straight to Hagrids Motorbike. The longest we waited all day was 2 hours for Hagrids, but no passes can be used on that ride. Otherwise, we waited between 0 and 15 minutes the rest of the day, riding every ride we wanted to. It was a great day with lots of memories made!  I would like to give credit to Nelson and Dan at the Raptor Encounter. We waited in the line for about 25 min and were rushed through by the man running the encounter. I wanted a photo of my kids together and then one of each of them separately. My son also wanted the separate photo because he loves Jurassic World and didn’t want his sister in his picture with Blue! Lol. Anyway, we were rushed through before I could take the separate photos. My husband spoke with Nelson and Dan at the entrance to the encounter about what happened and Nelson told us to come back at a specific time and we could get our photos. When my husband brought the kids back, Nelson gave them a private encounter with a baby raptor, as well as another chance at photos with Blue. He went above and beyond for us.

Charles & Pam D,4.0," April 1, 2021",Universal Resort Stay - Hotel and Park,"We stayed at the Dockside Universal hotel. Overall it wasn't a bad stay. But.....there's alway a big BUT.... there were some snafus. There was a long line when we got there late in the evening. The last thing we wanted was to wait in a long line. Well, we had to wait in a long line at the front counter. One girl working. Then, our reservations were messed up. Both our families were supposed to be in connecting rooms. That didn't happen. The front service representative got us two rooms down the hall from each other on opposite sides of the corridor. But, she was very pleasant, empathetic and apologetic about it. We had lots of luggage. The last thing we didn't want was to drag luggage up to the 4th floor. We went to the luggage area. They said there were no luggage carriers around and they didn't know where they were at. All they could tell us was that there were several somewhere throughout the hotel but couldn't tell us where. We then had to drag all the luggage upstairs by hand. A lot of walking for a large hotel. This was after a long tiring day of travel. Not what we were expecting or wanted. There was also long lines for elevators because of COVID protocols. After getting luggage to the room, we then went back downstairs to get something to eat. But, the downstairs food area was starting to close. As many people that were still in there around 11:00PM they probably could have left it open till 12:00AM and still would have been busy. No problems with loud ruckus or music. Slept well. Everything was fairly clean. The bus transport from hotel to Universal and back was efficient. No problem there. Staff took all sorts of pandemic measures including temp checks and making sure everyone wore their masks around the hotel and parks. One thing that I thought was very annoying that ended up causing a riff between a family member and a Universal staff member was figuring out where the child swap pick up area was at for rides. If you had a baby or child that couldn't go on a ride you could all go up together and then one or two could stay behind with the baby. When the first family group got done with the ride the rest could jump to the head of the line and get on the ride and typically not have to wait long in line. More or less jumping ahead of everyone else. After getting off the the Kong ride staff were ushering you quickly to get you out of there. We thought maybe the rest of our party was waiting outside. They weren't. We went back into the exit part of the ride. My son-in-law went under the rope to get to where he thought our daughter was with the baby. Oh my gosh, an older Universal staff member jumped all over him and told him he didn't know where he was going. My son-in-law said exactly, I don't, because you all rush people along and out the exit and don't make things clear where the connecting parties are located. I personally thought the way the older gentleman handle this situation was not professional. I felt he could have addressed this with my son-in-law in a much less confrontational and empathetic approach. He automatically assumed he was doing something bad and didn't ask what he needed, why he was going the way he was headed or asked if he could help him. This was the case with many of the child swap situation on rides. It's very confusing because on some rides the child swap area is back outside somewhere and then sometimes it could be inside somewhere. If you are going to use the child swap option please make sure you get decisive answers of where the party getting off the ride is supposed to meet the rest of the family party that is waiting. Very confusing and I feel the staff assumes everyone understands where you need to go. They work there. That's their office. They know it well. Here comes someone new to the park that has very little knowledge and they're trying to figure things out. The last thing they need on a vacation which is supposed to be fun is someone yelling at them at the very place they're suppose to have fun at. So between the hotel snafus and the some confusion and an altercation sat the park, overall, it wasn't bad.",Universal Studios Florida
Kaushik K,5.0," April 1, 2021",Awesome.. will go again!,"It was beyond expectations. Yea, the lines were long but they do give you the option to pay and get the express pass. Also the waiting areas for most rides are amazing. They’ve gone above and beyond to make sure the visitors don’t get bored and stay occupied in the queues. The Wizarding World of Harry Potter was certainly the highlight. Going to the park is worth it just for that alone.

Sara N,1.0," March 31, 2021",Worst Experience Ever. Huge Waste of Money!!!!,"TripAdvisor was AMAZING. Universal was a bunch of maskhole virtue signalers who were so “concerned” about covid that’s why the face diaper they tried to enforce constantly was very annoying and not worth the $650 we spent on tickets. Wake up people!!!! Masks will not “protect” you on rides packed with people or anywhere else. Why are healthy people masking? Are we afraid they will spread and share their good health?! Insert eye roll here. They ruined the experience for my kids by constantly telling all of us to wear or to pick up their masks. Also, kids are out of school, migrants are pouring into our country but Universal Studios is open?!!!!!! Don't worry, your mask will save you from a virus with a 99.9% survival rate. Heres an idea, for those that want to wear masks and socially distance, stay home.

We pre-purchased the tickets before our trip but we showed up on the wrong day. Went to Customer Services to have our tickets changed for that day, but Universal CHARGED US AN EXTRA $30.00 just to stay for the day. I didn't understand why, the park was already full of people? They gave the excuse it was because of crowd control! After did the temperature test, and got in, they had NO physical park maps!!! They told use we needed to use our cell phones. REALLY! Never been to a theme park that didn't have a map for their guests! The park was wall to wall people (so much for crowd control). the wait times for the rides was 60 - 90 minutes or LONGER - we only went on 4 rides.

James M,5.0," March 30, 2021",Get the express pass,"I was very happy with our time at Universal. We had the unlimited express pass because we stayed at the Hard Rock Hotel. Yes, it was expensive, but time is money and we did notice the really long lines for standby. However, there is an outlet if you have an unlimited express pass and we did not wait more than 20 minutes for any ride during days parks were at capacity. We had so much fun and spent 2.5 days there and rode almost all the rides and did some shopping too. Disney, on the other hand, has no outlet they discontinued Fastpass and we had no choice but to wait in line and that is a bad experience. Honestly, Disney doesn't social distance either and they force you to wait in long lines with huge crowds. At Least Universal actively gives each person hand sanitizer and tries to at least make sure they do something. The hand sanitizer stations at Disney are far less and some don't even work. My suggestion is if you are going during a peak time you must have this express pass. It is hot and waiting in lines all day is not only exhausting but not fun at all.",Universal Studios Florida

I wish I would have done more research before we did...would have saved us $750+ Our family decided to take a mini vacation to Orlando this past weekend. Since we normally go to Disney Parks we decided to change things up and try Universal Studios. What a mistake.!!! The experience was horrible. Wait times for rides were on average 75min-120+min per ride. No social distancing as the park was overcrowded. We decided not to eat at the park since the lines were so terribly long and food was very expensive. We've never been to a theme park were the kids were actually begging to leave. We wanted to get some of our moneys worth so we stayed til 3pm and rode 4 rides total for the day. So I guess you can say we paid about $35 a ride on average per ride. The experience as a whole was not at all what we were anticipating. We all decided as a family we would never go back again.

It broke and they needed to rescue us. We were suspended about 40 feet in the air for about 30 minutes. My daughter was visibly shaking and crying after our rescue. They gave us a 1 ride express pass for our troubles... incredibly cheap. And as for the food, we paid 17 for a cheese burger and fries. Took 60 minutes and we only got it because we asked about the order otherwise they would of forgotten about us. Food was cold, probably sitting out 40 minutes.

We went into the park and were able to visit 2 rides for which we were on the lines for total of 1 hour (the rides were 2 mins each). No social distancing on lines by the way. On the third ride as we are waiting on line for the ride someone decides to cut the line in front of us. The people who were in front of us were calling up more family members up the line. We tried to ask them Politely not to do it.. they ignored us and kept calling more family members up the line. This led to a scuffle, which we did not initiate.. and did not even retaliate. WE CALLED ON SECURITY. For that we were thrown out of the park and banned for a year. My 3 year old missed on the experience and needless to say I don’t think we’re ever going back. They did not even offer money back for the park tickets.. in many years of us visiting different theme parks all over the world, we’ve never had such a horrible experience.

Of course the rides were everything we imagined, but what stuck out most to me was hospitality from the staff. The one person who made a great impression on the park was Hollie on the Universal Park side. She stood out there on one of the corners, and what went from the occasional ""where is this located"" turned into a wonderful conversation about the park, what rides to get on now before they become too crowded, the best rides between both parks, the suggestive selling to upgrade to both parks (totally recommend for only $60 per person), and the flat out friendliness. Completely made our day. If that wasn't enough, as we were walking away, she shouted, MAKE SURE YOU GET THE BUTTER BEER! You can tell she loves people, and it showed. If she can read this, the Fast & Furious ride was mediocre compared to the ones mentioned. You're not missing much unless you're a die hard F&F fan.",Universal Studios Florida

In our opinion, this should not even be called an ""Amusement"" park. The value of entertainment that you receive for the high price of admission and parking is very low compared to other options such as all of the Disney parks or even a place like FunSpot. Universal only has 1 true roller coaster, which was closed on the day that we went due to high winds, and every other ride is some sort of Virtual Reality experience.

Our 6yo was too short for some things and 7yo too skittish for some things and they still had a great time - our group got along great and the non-thrillseekers enjoyed watching the thrill seekers get gforce-smooshed on mega coasters. Kristi even entertained the kids while us parents went on the Forbidden Journey. Breakfast & lunch at cafe la bamba was great. Some rides broke down while we were enroute & guide Kristi adjusted on the fly. In the end we went on:  Fast and the Furious Race through New York Forbidden Journey Escape from Gringotts Hagrids Magical Motorbikes Hogwarts Express (twice) Spiderman The Hulk Hollywood Rip Ride Rocket Bourne Stuntacular Transformers  By evening time lines were shorter & after the tour we used express pass access to hit lots of other rides in rapid succession.

Jami Lynn,1.0," March 26, 2021",Terrible experience,"Worst “vacation” I’ve ever been on. How in the world can fast passes cost $300 per person and per park!?! Yet advertised as starting at $69. My family of 4 for 2 park days would’ve cost us $2400 just for fast passes! And how can you have the most popular ride (hagrid) as a virtual wait only and not give the option to wait in line? Because it was impossible to get a virtual time slot. Why isn’t this communicated before purchasing tickets? The wait times in general are ridiculous. Also the amount of times the staff asked my 4 year old to put his mask over his nose was over the top. I understand guidelines and we tried our best to keep it on him but it got ridiculous. We wouldn’t even be near people and a staff member would walk over to tell him. 2 staff members who thought they were funny on a sound system with a microphone called him out as he had his water bottle in his hand drinking! And to recommend the Avanti Palm resort as an affiliated hotel says a lot about your customer service. That place is a complete dump. We tried to get our reservations changed but couldn’t get anyone to help us out for about 6 hours total on the phone!!!! By then, it was too late to wake up our 2 children and change hotels. We couldn’t take the overwhelming smell of weed and complete lack of cleanliness! It was so disgusting we left the second day as soon as we exited the park and drove 6 hours home to avoid another night there. This was possibly the worst experience we’ve ever had any where. When a 4 year old and an 11 year old beg to leave and drive home, you know it’s bad! I think the worst part is, no one with Universal is willing to make it right.

Ccorinium,4.0," March 26, 2021","Fun park, just hard to get food","Really enjoyed the park. Diagon Alley is outstanding. Also loved Revenge of the Mummy and Race through New York. We were staying on property so had the express passes and highly recommend them, they saved us so much time and allowed us to do our favorite rides multiple times. Two things could have been better. My husband and son stood in line for 45 minutes (with the express pass) for Rip Ride Rockit and got on the ride before someone decided to double check my son’s height, pulled him off the ride and decided he wasn’t quite tall enough. I wish they’d do these checks at the beginning of the line and also be more consistent (a kid smaller than him in front of them got on the ride no problem). The other frustrating thing was how hard it was to get food. Even the pretzel stands were a good 15-20 minute wait. And if you plan to sit down to eat, go at least an hour before you’re actually hungry. It took us 90 minutes to get some chicken fingers and a cheese pizza in the Simpsons area. Outside of those two issues, we really did have a great time though.",Universal Studios Florida
Nia G,3.0," March 25, 2021",Cool!,Universal was trying to overcharge for express passes! I didn’t like it at all especially when they filled the park to 90 percent capacity unlike Disney that was way less crowded! The park itself was great but too many people!,Universal Studios Florida
memorabletrip,4.0," March 24, 2021",We had a good time,"This was our first trip to universal studios and Island of adventures . It was decent, you get spoiled by Disney, so some aspects I was disappointed. For example they sold us the quick service but we couldn’t use it at the universal hotel we stayed at. They didn’t mention that when you were doing the purchase and it was limited as to where you could use it since a lot of places weren’t open in the morning (we got to the park right as they opened at 7) and might as well forget trying to get into the three broomsticks for breakfast. So we basically paid for every meal and gave 8 snacks and 3 meals away before we left there in hopes that they would get used. Also we purchased the photo pass and that was useless as there was only one person at the entrance of both parks. I literally paid to take my own pictures. Possibly 16 pictures all at the entrances and all they did was have my son do different poses and I have 3 pictures that don’t even belong to us. So don’t waste your money. Next time I will check a bag to bring my own snacks and drinks. Since I have never been I am not sure if the lack of available meal places or photographers is due to covid but in that case they need to have that info before you purchase or do like Disney and not offer them due to covid. Other than that, I was very impressed that they were very on top of making sure everyone stayed 6 feet for social distance. I liked that neither park was overwhelming like I feel like Disney is.we did 4 park days and really could have gotten away with 3. 1 park day each first 2 days and the 3rd day just to explore shops and do rides we liked a second time. I also would like to make a suggestion for the app, be more specific about the ride info. If it’s a high speed coaster it should say it in the app. We got ushered (never had to wait in line) right to the seat for the revenge of the mummy. Because I was in front of the line I just lead and didn’t look around. Apparently there was a sign right before you got on the ride that it was high speed but I didn’t see it as the worker walked me right to the seat. My husband saw it but didn’t say “hey I thought you said this was a virtual ride” so with a smaller child, it’s not our type of ride. My son is 13 but is the size of a 9/10 yo so I was afraid he would fall out and it was dark. Haha We were terrified. Lol so I would like to see in the future a better filter for the app. Like filter not only to which park you are in but more of a list view of places to eat or things to ride. All of those small dots are overwhelming and you have to click each and every one just to see which ride or food place it is to eat. Either way we had a great trip and can’t wait to go back.",Universal Studios Florida
Jill T,2.0," March 23, 2021",Express Passes Make Everyone Else Wait 2+ Hours,"We opted not to purchase the express passes since they cost more than the one day ticket. So we’ve waited more than two hours in multiple lines because the express pass customers get so much priority. On The Hulk rollercoaster, one family rode THREE TIMES while we waited in line. I get that they paid the ridiculous $195 apiece for that express pass, but let’s be reasonable. And this is with restricted capacity due to Covid. Also, we got into the park at 7:20 am (opens at 8) and within minutes there were no more virtual line times for Hagrid’s motorcycle ride, which means even though we were among the first people here, we will not get to ride that today. Needless to say, we’re disappointed with all the wasted time today. Universal can and should do better.",Universal Studios Florida

Like any amusement park, it is packed but it seems exceptionally longer here than other places. One of the rides - Harry Potter and the escape of the gringotts was 300 minutes wait. Once we got on the ride, it was fun. At the end of the ride, it was stuck and we waited inside of the super tight locked for 20-30 minutes. I was very anxious and had to use the restroom and they didn’t tell us what was happening. Just a prerecorded message that they were delayed. Once it finally came back on and they released the locks, the gave us one ticket each for a fast pass ride of our choice.  The food options are great. Especially the seafood restaurant- Lombards landing. Prepare to wait a bit for food.  Most rides are 3D rides, some interactive, like the men in black. All fun and movie inspired rides.

James L,4.0," March 23, 2021",Great Time at Universal Studios!!!,"This was our First time visiting Orlando, Florida (Please get some Comfortable Shoes, a lot of walking and bring plenty of Money, lol). We knew we wanted to go to Universal Studio so we ended up doing the 2 Park, 2 Day Pass (Wednesday, Thursday). We rented our Car from Avis which gave us a free upgrade to ""Prime Parking"" (Parking is $26 a day, Prime Parking is $40). We parked in their very nice huge garages and madr the long walk to the Park. The first Park we visited was Universal Studios Hollywood. The park is overwhelming and every attention to detail was diplayed throughout. The Park was very Clean and everyone was practicing Social Distancing and they had several employees cleaning during the day. There were plenty of Restaurants, Rest Areas and Restrooms located throughout. The only ride that we did not lime was ""The Fast and Furious"". I saw a quote that I am going to use, ""There was nothing Fast about the Attraction and we were Furious we waited that long in line"". All of the other Rides and Attractions were very good. The Harry Potter section seems like a world all by itself.  The next day we visited Island Of Adventures. This Park was very clean and nice also. We did not make it the Jurassic Park area. The Harry Potter on this side is more detailed especially with the Castle. When you get inside both of the parks, you will see why the price of Tickets are like they are. We had kids with us and at times you can't put a price on Adventure, Excitement and pure Fun for the Family. Overall, we enjoyed our time and just outside the Park is Universal City Walk with some good restaurants. We ate at Panda Express one day and the next we at Bubba Gump Shrimp. The overall interaction with the staff and employees were very pleasant from the Parking Booth, to Parking Attendants, Police/Security, employees taking temperatures, ticket takers, cleaning crews, ride attendants, gift shop, and restaurant workers.

Breanna Pennock,1.0," March 23, 2021",Worst Customer Experience of my Life,"I have NEVER in my entire life, been treated so poorly at a tourist attraction as we were here.  We worked our butts off to get on the virtual line for the Hagrid line, and even had a sweet lady who offered us some of her expired line tickets to get our group in, a group of mostly teenage girls (8 of them).  We waited in line for 1.5 hrs, yes 90 minutes AFTER getting the virtual line. But that’s not the bad part.  After waiting in line for 1.5 hrs, the worker at the front said he had been watching our group the entire time and we would have to leave because the girls hadn’t been wearing their masks OVER their nose.  Let me repeat, they had been WATCHING us, for AN HOUR AND A HALF, and because the TEENAGERS couldn’t keep their mask over their NOSE after 12 HOURS wearing masks in the park, we had to leave the ride.  No warning, no hey, could you please keep your mask above your nose or we’ll have to ask you to leave, no nothing.  I’m sorry but have you EVER been around teenagers who’ve been wearing their mask for 12 hours straight. They NEVER took off their mask and were NEVER disrespectful when people asked them to cover their nose. While they were talking and dancing and playing games in line during the 90 minute wait, it would occasionally slip and they would fix it.  I didn’t realize employees here don’t know how to communicate effectively, or are crazy power hungry that they get pleasure over watching teenagers in line for 1.5 hrs just to kick them off at the front. It’s crazy, I have NEVER experienced anything like it, and I am so disappointed in Universal. I’m in shock honestly of how we were treated and singled out like that.  The very next ride I went on, I saw a group of teenagers doing the exact same thing ahead of me in line, and NOT A WORD from the staff about it.  Disappointed, shocked and honestly hurt over how we were treated. Honestly, a day later the situational is almost laughable at how badly it was handled. Wow. You could’ve handled it so much better Universal, but instead you lost 10 families and their business and respect for you.",Universal Studios Florida
davidtheath,1.0," March 22, 2021",Offended That Fast and The Furious is Allowed to Remain Open,"On a whole, Universal studios and Islands of Adventure are amazing. You should honestly go, it's awesome. What they did with Harry Potter worlds is nothing short of awe inspiring.  However, I am leaving one star review because of simple fact that they allow The Fast and Furious ride to remain open.  We waited 90 minutes to ride what I can only describe as the worst ride in the history of rides. It was so lame that the the queue experience was honestly better than the ride, and that part sucked as well.  It is so bad that all the park employees and staff know the second you mention it they feel a tremendous sense of embarrassment and shame.  Look, we don't expect anyone to be perfect or bat 1000, but it is offensive to park goers to allow them to waste their time to go on this ride. Just admit you made a mistake and close it. It literally does more harm simply keeping it open.  My group spent more time talking about how much we hated that ride than we did talking about how amazing the new Hadgrids $300mm roller coaster was - which is a HUGE feat considering it is one of the top 3 rides I've ever experienced in my life.  How can the same company who has created an incredible and immersive Harry Potter experience where park goes can buy plastic wands that can make stuff happen throughout the park in a truly magical experience allow a ride like Fast and the Furious to remain open.  Universal knows it's terrible and the park goers know it's terrible so just take it behind the barn and put us all out of our misery.",Universal Studios Florida

They loved the Mummy and Rock and Ride roller coaster but that was about it. Luckily we had express passes as we stayed at the Hard Rock, so we were able to ride all the rides by noon! The express passes are amazing. Some of the rides had a 120 minute wait and we waited maybe 4 minutes! The longest we waited in line was 15 minutes! We were mad that we didn’t buy the hopper pass to visit Island of Adventure as we would have had plenty of time due to the express passes.  Definitely buy lanyards for your passes. You need to show/scan them on every ride so a lanyard is very handy. Pack light when you visit as some rides don’t allow even a phone! You need to put everything in a locker. Some lockers are free during that ride and others charge you.  If you plan to leave the park and eat at city walk, make reservations!

Mike Dee,1.0," March 20, 2021",Overpriced For What's Available,I went during March Spring break. The tickets were priced high because they said they were sold out and that it was Spring Break is what they told me. If you purchase your ticket at the gate please keep in mind that no discounts will be honored for a one day visit. It doesn't matter who you are a member of. They push for multi day and multi park specials. There are some attractions that are closed for the kids. Wood Pecker Village was mostly closed. When the rides get really full they make people do the Virtual line experience which is an app you install and reserve a time to ride. You will get a code to use to enter the ride. Express pass cant even get in unless they schedule it. The Mummy Experience was one such ride and difficult to ride because of this. You are not able to eat in some restaurants. Be prepared to wait for 30 mins 1hr for the line and another 1 hr for your food to be ready. I feel they shouldn't be charging more for offering less.,Universal Studios Florida
Yestochristina,5.0," March 19, 2021",Great for teenagers and above,We got discounted tickets through ID me for being nurses. We went as a girls trip. I wouldn't recommend taking children smaller than 14 because there is a lot of aggressive movement from the rides. This park is not for smaller children. The best part of taking the smaller children is that it has the characters for them to see but it is not really for smaller children. Definitely a great time wait time even with the pandemic was reasonable. They did a great job with keeping it spaced out and accommodating. The tacos in Simpson land are delicious. Harry Potter world definitely is a 2 to 3 hour adventure. I would head their last so you can get your wand which is expensive 50 dollars for something that only works in Harry Potter world if you get the cheaper one which I think is like 47 it is not interactive. Great time all together the Mummy ride was my favorite. BUTTER BEER is amazing. Hand sanitizer is given to everyone who is riding the ride and hand sanitizer is around the park.,Universal Studios Florida
krristoph,2.0," March 19, 2021",Overcrowded money grab,"We are staying on resort for four days. The accommodations are comfortable and convenient. Where things go south are at the theme parks. Poor signage that makes it difficult to navigate the parks. Overcrowded! We were under the impression that the parks were open but with reduced capacity. That did not appear to be the case. Wall to wall people with ride times that were 1-2 hour waits. There was always the option to purchase Express Passes, but due to high demand Universal jacked up the prices for 3 Express passes to $900+. Not that the Mouse is less greedy, but it’s more organized and they still offer limited Fast Passes. We won’t be returning. Moving forward we will stick with the Mouse.",Universal Studios Florida
Madison M,1.0," March 19, 2021",Oversold Overcrowded Disorganized,"They oversell tickets instead of having an organized reservation system. We had tickets, showed up early in the morning, park was at capacity. We stood in a stand by line where staff tried to encourage people to leave. Wanting to get what we paid for we ended up sitting in line for an hour and a half which is rediculous considering what we paid for tickets just to enter the park. Once we got in it was excessive crowds, kids not wearing masks properly. We've recently had Covid and weren't worried about getting it but if you are worried, don't come here. Their lack of organization is awful. Ride technology was not impressive.",Universal Studios Florida
Steven P,2.0," March 18, 2021",Treated like cattle,They put to many people in the park to allow social distancing. Especially at the entry we were treated like cattle ith no way to social distance.  As expected the food was over-priced but that is to be expected. I was frustrated that they didn't have enough food outlets to have a reasonable wait to get food. For lunch we had to wait over an hour and a half with a over-hungry seven year old.. Would have given him a snack but bringing in food is against their rules.  R,Universal Studios Florida
Dave L,1.0," March 18, 2021",Still can’t figure out food,"1.5 hours to eat. Do better Universal. Never enough access to food. When you have tired kids it is not good to wait 1.5 hours to eat. When you can eat you get weird crap line roast beefs sandwiches and turkey legs. just make burgers and chicken nuggets easy to purchase. If chick fillet can do it, i think universal can figure it out. Or should be able to figure it out.",Universal Studios Florida
Whydidwegohere..withkids,2.0," March 18, 2021","Long ride lines, no social distancing over Spring Break - Read for tips","We recently spent the day at Universal Studios and while it has some neat attractions, features, and rides, I have to give this a ""poor"" rating due mostly to massive crowds they seem to be letting in (during COVID no less) and our inability to see or do much. Our 7 hours at the park only allowed us to 2 rides due moslty to fighting crowds. We were left exhausted and frustrated. For those of you planning a trip let me give you some tips and warnings:  1.) LONG LINES FOR RIDES - GET EXPRESS PASS: If you are coming to ride the rides, you almost certainly will need to buy an Express Pass, which is an additional purchase over the regular ticket cost (our regular one day ticket was $140+tax without the express pass which would have been another $80 or $90). Just bite the bullet and buy them if you want to ride several rides. It will likely take your wait down to 15 minutes give or take to wait for a ride. Otherwise, lines for those without the express pass were VERY long on a Tuesday we were there. Most of the rides had anywhere from 90 minutes to 200-minute wait (Harry Potter) all day with some of the less popular rides dipping down to 35 to 60 minute waits later in the day. only to fill back up to hour-plus waits as people check the Universal app and see the shorter lines. To give you an idea, we rode 2 rides in the 7 hours we were there. Universal had a huge crowd and is selling tons of tickets which leads me to my next point.  2.) SOCIAL DISTANCING: Beware if you're concerned about COVID and want to social distance. I'm not a fanatic about it but Universal's reminders to social distance was a joke. I don't know if Universal has reduced capacity due to COVID but if they have it surely can't be much. Everywhere we went - walking the streets, waiting in lines, standing in shops -- you will bump into people. LOTS of people. It's not enforced because it's impossible. Universal will occasionally make rote announcements telling people to social distance. It was like having a pool party and telling people to get in but try and stay dry. Can't be done unless you stay out. If you don't care about social distancing then this won't be an issue.  3.) MASKS REQUIRED: This is taken pretty seriously. Expect someone to tell you to put your mask on if they see you walking around without one or wearing it around your chin. They were pretty serious about masks for the most part.  4.) FOOD EXPENSIVE AND LONG LINES: I get it, this is a theme park so not a shock. But $52 for 3 hot dogs, 3 bags of chips & three drinks. Crazy. It took someone from our group of 10 about 45 minutes to get 2 tacos with only about 10 people in line. Super slow. My tip is to bring a bottle of water to refill and a few snacks to get you by if you're not interested in spending time waiting in line on expensive very average food. Then save your money and eat somewhere else outside the park.  4.) VIRTUAL LINE: A few rides/experiences have a virtual line you can reserve on the Universal app. A limited number of virtual passes are released every 2 or 3 hours during the day - e.g. 11 a.m., 2 p.m., 4 p.m. -so you have to be on the app when they're released otherwise you're out of luck. The Jimmy Falon NY Experience ride was really great. I wish Universal would increase the use of the virtual line option for more attractions.   5.) ORDERING FOOD ON APP: We ordered three butter beers from Harry Potter land hoping to be able to just pick them up. No luck. We had to wait in line with everyone else for 20 minutes. In other words, pre-ordering the butter beers was a complete waste of time. Universal really needs to figure this out.  6.SOME ATTRACTIONS LOOKING TIRED: Some of the rides could use a refresh. ET and Men in Black, as examples, might be classics but for Universal to stay relevant they should consider changing these over with so many more good movies and pop culture icons to pick from.  Overall, I don't think we would go back anytime soon. We paid $600 for 4 tickets plus another $200 or so for souvenirs, food, and parking. $800 for a day is a lot of money. It's just too much to fight massive crowds and not get much accomplished all while wearing a mask and being told to social distance when it's impossible.",Universal Studios Florida
Eileen C.,1.0," March 17, 2021","DON'T purchase their vacation package, IMPOSSIBLE to cancel, even WITH travel protection!","Warning! Save your money! Don't book their vacation packages! NEVER purchase travel protection! You will NOT be able to cancel and waste your money.  I recently purchased a vacation package (hotel + tickets + travel protection) via Universal's official website. Purchase and payment via the website were seamless and easy.  But if you have the slighted chance of changing or cancelling the package afterwards, just don't purchase the package and especially not their travel protection (""Cancel for Any Reason"") because you will NOT be able to do so. Other than the purchase, if you want to change or cancel, you MUST do so via the phone and can NOT do so via the website or mobile app.  You will NEVER be able to reach them at the number they give you, though. I tried for days, each time holding the line for over an hour. Today, I'm practically on the phone the whole day. No use.  Problem is, if you don't succeed until the check-in date of your reservation, you will be forfeited the whole purchase amount. Yes! No joke.  So, to sum up. Don't book Universal if there is even the slighted chance your plans may change. Don't purchase travel purchase, because that's another hundred dollars wasted. You may be able to cancel for any reason but NOT at any time because you CANNOT get them to pick up your call.",Universal Studios Florida
Jim P,1.0," March 17, 2021",Waste of time and money,"Terrible experience. They obviously don’t care either. The place was absolutely packed. Lines for most rides were 90 minutes and some were over 2 hours thus making it impossible to ride more than 7-8 rides despite being there for almost 11 hours and paying over $600 for 3 tickets.  At 1130 am one vendor had no ice so we were given drinks with no ice. We went to an icee vendor who had no icee’s, an ice cream vendor with no ice cream, only finding out after...waiting in long lines.  The few rides we went on were great but not worth the time or the cost.",Universal Studios Florida
Tamara W,2.0," March 17, 2021",Such a disappointing day!,"We went early, 7am to assure we get into the park. Even though tickets are purchased for a certain day, admission is not guaranteed.  All fast passes were sold out. With that said, Harry Potter ride was 140 minutes wait about all day as well as many other rides. We did not ride all rides due to the wait.  My daughter did the woodpecker ride alone and had a stranger sat next to her——-where are the COVID rules there????  Universal is NOT releasing capacity numbers, there is no way this park is functioning with decreased capacity the week of 3/15!!!! Absolutely ridiculous.

Florida is a mask RECOMMENDED state,, but Sick Money grab Disney and Universal make it a capital offense!!

Bebe,1.0," March 15, 2021",TICKETS ARE WORTHLESS/scam to get your money,"If a park sells tickets those tickets should be a reservation for the park instead of a standby ticker one may not even be able to use. It's a scam for the public to make up the lost revenue due to covid shut downs and limited capacity. If one buys a day ticket it is guaranteed access. If one buys a ticket good for 4 days one stands in line on standby. Which may or may not happen. Park has extended hours and one may assume because of extended hours they have increased number of ticket sells as well. We flew from DALLAS, TEXAS with young children to stand in standby line for hours with zero shade. Good thing the restaurants will give you FREE cups of water..... So far that water has cost us the price of 3 adult, 2 children 2 park/4 day passes. Thanks Universal Studios for making our incredibly important spring break a disaster!!! Oh and these tickets are NON REFUNDABLE!! THIS SPRING BREAK WAS EXTREMELY IMPORTANT FOR OUR FAMILY and so far it's a far bigger disappointment than I can even express adequately here on this review.",Universal Studios Florida
sdotSLC,4.0," March 14, 2021",Tips for newbies!,"Had a great time even though it was CROWDED! We stayed on Universal property so we had the Unlimited Express Pass. WORTH it!!! Even though it was spring break and the part was near capacity we never waited more than 30 min for a ride. Most the time we walked right on. Here are a few tips:  1. Virtual tickets - if you select your time and then move the slider to two the tickets are gone. If you select the time and leave it at 1 you'll get them but you have to go on right when it says.... like set an alarm 1 min before and just sit and try and try until it hits that time. You'll get them if you do this. If not, they are gone by 1 min after the time it says. Hagrid's let us on with 2 even though ticket was for 1. They would have left the 2nd seat open anyway for covid procedures. 2. Terrace Falls! Best lunch. Get the chicken rice bowl. We went there twice during our 4 days. Loved it! 3. Citywalk - make reservations days in advance or be prepared to get your food togo and eat on the sidewalk or your room. 4. Harry Potter areas are SO CROWDED from open to about 6pm, that was our fav time to visit them. Let the crowds calm down and then go. 5. DONT waste your time with Fast and Furious. Wow - worst ride ever. I'm so surprised this one is a virtual line. It was terrible. 6. Hagrid - once we figured out the trick I mentioned above we got to ride this one about 3 times a day. 7. Toothsome Chocolate - Food is meh, desserts are great. Go for dessert and skip the food.  Universal staff was very nice. Very pleased with covid procedures. It WAS so nice standing in line and having space between parties. I hope this is the new standard forever! Way less gross smells along the way...haha.  One grip to Universal - WHY are there no rides that are female based?!? Literally, the only one in both parks was some Storm ride that was closed. Please add some!!",Universal Studios Florida

I went to both parks every time and the transition was seamless.

If it’s working days (Mon-Wed) you can try almost all sideshows (2 parks) at one day. If it’s crowded weekend the best way to try everything is express pass.

Robert G,5.0," February 28, 2021",Universal Orlando Florida Nonprivate VIP Experience,"(I REALLY hope this doesn't break any rules) Spoilers???  A Subjective Review – Non-private VIP Experience Universal Orlando Resort By Robert Gerber Day 3 of our vacation, 26 Feb 2021 (Friday) My Thoughts: I give this a 5/5. Although we had had 2 days in the parks (Wednesday the 25 was mostly spent at IOA; Thursday the 26 was spent mostly at US) and rode everything we wanted and more, the semi private / non-private experience provided a well paced opportunity to enjoy the park, the rides, and some fun facts. I’ll be walking you through the experience shortly, but let me say – this is not a walking tour as you would through a major city or attraction. One of the big bonuses of this tour, as I’m sure many of you are aware – you will walk on to all rides. There were two individuals on our tour who I must give credit and were super champs and sucked it up. I don’t think they knew what they were getting into. I tried to be supportive as I was them two years ago. They told me they appreciated it – they made it easier to participate. By early afternoon, they ditched the tour. I felt so bad, but I would recommend – read up on what you’re getting into! 😊 I had been told, when you check in in the morning, kindly ask – you want EVERYONE to have fun, but you want to kindly request to be grouped with a like-minded, like aged tour so you all get what you want. I have to say, Universal did an excellent job at doing this. Of the 6 of us who remained, 4 of us rode Rip Ride Rocket and Hulk… the rest of the rides, we all did, and it was so much fun! Oh, and The Fast and the Furious broke down before we could get on – I was not sad haha. How much did this run me for 2 persons? 511USD with Tax. To me, was it worth it after having express passes and annual preferred passes that gave us the 10% discount and unlimited express passes from our stay at royal pacific (which was amazing by the way) and were able to walk on to 99% rides in less than 5 minutes? YES.  Fun Note: Hagrids Motorbike adventure, from someone who HATES roller coasters – is AMAZING. I’m happy to suggest, if you had coasters – watch the youtube POV videos and prepare for the 1 backwards drop (which isn’t bad) and the 1 story drop which has a soft landing and also isn’t bad – god this was amazing. Rode it 5 times in 3 days. Would’ve been more, but it broke down mid-morning on our first day. In the afternoon, when the Queue read 75-90 minute way… we weren’t in queue for longer than 20 minutes FYI! Keep that in mind for during the middle of the week. We were able to end our vacation on Hagrids, run over for butterbeer icecream and a dragonscale brew. What a great ending to a great vacation. I hope you all get to have as magical an experience as my wife and I had.  Now, on to the review…  Non-Private/Semi-Private VIP Experience: 26 FEB 2021  AM: Arrived at the VIP Entry near guest services at USO. They let us in around 8:25AM. I made my request to kindly be paired with a group of the same age, and mindset for coasters. They were funny and polite – and understood. We were escorted to La Bamba for Breakfast. The menu was pretty good. I had the overnight oats, my wife the ham, egg, and cheese. We both had coffee. Obviously it was included in the cost of the tour, but I still tipped out waitress 10$. We sat at a long table with 6 others. We all began chatting and learned most of us had the same thoughts of roller coasters. The only ones excited about Hulk and RRR were my wife, another young lady with her girlfriend (girlfriend was like me), and a pair of younger siblings. The 4th pair (two moms) were not big on rides, but again, were super champs.  The Beginning: Universal Studios - At 9:20 our tour guide Dave introduced himself. Dave has worked there for 10 years and I must say, he rolls with the punches. Very pleasant, very polite, and very knowledgeable. He worked his hardest to make this experience as enjoyable for all of us. We left breakfast and headed over to our first ride, Transformers. Up to this point in our vacation, we had not ridden this, but it was very enjoyable. I forgot I enjoyed it more than Spiderman (we rode on Day 1 of this vacation). 1 of the 2 moms declared after this she was done. I felt bad. Dave was very supportive, and I let the moms know I was like them when I came to universal – scared out of my mind. I tried to be supportive and mentally prepare them for the drops, spins, and scary moments so if they know it’s coming – it’s easier to tolerate. 1 of them sucked it up on most rides. The other sat out 99% of the rides and I felt bad. Not to be selfish though, I came to enjoy myself though! I can lead a horse to water, but I can’t make it drink. Dave continued to walk us through giving us detailed history of the park… and then walked us over to THE MUMMY. 😊 Took a backdoor entrance, and like Transformers, we walked onto this ride. This was my wife and my 4th time on this ride during our vacation. Always fun, and the updates to this ride since its refurbishment are a nice touch! My first time on this coaster, I was cursing my wife out for bringing me with her. Now, I LOVE it. It’s NOT bad as far as coasters go.. and it’s fun. It’s also nice to see Brendan Fraiser finally gets his coffee LOL.  From there, we got some backstory on the New York Skyline, and then walked onto Jimmy Fallon’s Race through New York. We all rode this, I believe. It’s not as exciting as I remembered it, but It used to be my warm up ride (yes, 2 years ago I was that big of a chicken).  From Jimmy fallon, we walked over to Rip Ride Rocket. I’ll just say 4 of the 8 of us rode this, including my brave wife. I sat down, reapplied sunscreen as it was 86 degrees already.. and laughed.  Next up, to accommodate the entire group, was ET. I was game – this was actually a fun ride 😊 Not a thriller, but for 1990 technology, really cool to see. We also learned that Steven Spielberg won’t let this ride go anywhere as he was the significant influence over the construction of this park. When it was destroyed at Universal Studios Hollywood, he was not happy. I won’t ruin what I thought was the coolest part… (but it’s towards the end).  Following ET, we skipped over Simpsons, but I can tell you having done it the day before – it isn’t 3d, but it is a virtual simulation (like Minions, but better)… and it was a lot of fun. Something for all ages, but can cause motion sickness. My wife and I enjoyed it – but would only do once. Anyhow, we headed over to MIB. Again, walked right on… and it was fun. I learned that if you shoot the blue tower at the back of the car in front or across from you, you get points and they spin out. Of course, our car wouldn’t stop spinning. It was fun! This was our 3rd time on this ride during this vacation. 😊  After MIB, we went to Fast and The furious, but conveniently – it broke down. I wasn’t sad. I wasn’t excited to ride it. We left this without riding and went to lunch at Finnegan’s in New York. Great place to eat. My wife and I didn’t want heavy food in our stomach, so we stuck to the salmon (which was delicious!) and the soda bread (complimentary). FYI – lunch is included. Oh and before I forget – Water and Ponchos (only 1) are complimentary/included in your tour.  PM: USO to IOA: Following Lunch, we went over Diagon Alley. We had a bit of a short tour, and some fun information (which is great for potter heads like us, and non potter heads alike). From there… Gringotts!!! Already my wife and I had been on this 7 or 8 times this trip… so this is 8 or 9… I lost count. ALWAYS FUN!!! All but 1 went on 😊 Those who were scared, definitely said this was great. It is a great fun semi-coaster. 1 story drop, 1 story up. Some slow turns/spins, but you’re so immersed in the ride, you don’t notice! Again, we walked on. This is a fun perk. Over to the Hogwarts Express. We didn’t hold up the queue to record ourselves running through platform 9 and ¾ LOL… I felt like such a jerk, but so much fun. Got a video of my wife and I running through, and running back through. From there… backdoor entrance and walked onto the Hogwarts Express to Hogsmeade. EVEN with Express passes… we had to still wait 30 minutes the other days! (NOTE: During the week, the path between the two parks is NOT open except on Weekends!) Once we got into Hogsmeade, we got a quick backstory and tour, put our “luggage” into the lockers and we were off to ride Hagrids, and then Forbidden Journey back to back. I must give huge props to one of the moms – she sucked it up and came on Hagrids. I asked her if she wanted me to prompt her. She said yes…. So I was trying to walk her through it during the ride. She said she appreciated it – but still ended up getting sick. I had a new found respect for her! I honestly tried to help her since she wanted to ride, and experience it. I told Dave, our guide, that I apologize – I’m not trying to step on his toes – I know exactly how she felt and I thought if she did what I’ve done – it would help a lot! He said it was ok and he appreciated it. It helps the tour move along. Well, of course we walked onto Hagrids – AMAZING RIDE AND I WANT TO GO BACK AND RIDE AGAIN – and then straight to Forbidden Journey. Both Amazing Rides!!!! Forbidden Journey, I think my wife and I rode 12 times in 3 days. Lol Always fun! I did get slight motion sickness my last 2 times… I don’t know why. Probably fatigue as it was end of the day those last 2 times. Following forbidden Journey… it was off to Jurassic Park River Adventure. I have bad memories here… I ended up getting pneumonia 2 years ago after riding, getting soaked, shivering in Mythos, and going home and getting SICK for 3 months. Bacterial Pnemonia is NOT fun. Disclaimer: I did NOT get pneumonia from this ride or from Mythos. My explanation is the shivering weakened my immune system as shown in the literature – whatever infiltrate took advantage and took over and BAM! It hit me. Next onto Marvel! The world based on the comics, not the movies lol. We walked onto the Spiderman… Learned some fun facts that you should take the tour to learn… but onto Spiderman – which is always fun, and finally… The Hulk! Of course we were down to 6 the two moms were superchamps and thank you to them for going with the flow of the group! I really appreciate it. Only 4 of 6 of us rode (not me!), but my wife did. I just remember looking up, thinking my wife’s car is next and all I hear is “Ooooooooooooooooh ********” as the Hulk Launched. It was a guy though, and not my wife – but I would’ve thought that be hilarious if it was. I’m really thinking, next time we go down – which I hope is in October or November, I’ll do either Hulk or Rip Ride Rocket… probably RRR since it doesn’t go upside down…. After the tour ended, Dave said goodbye… I gave him a 20% tip for a fun day (100$USD)… and we apologized as my wife and I wanted to end the day on Hagrids, and then a Butter beer ice cream and a dragonscale brew. Our tour went over a bit, which we really appreciated the amazing day – but we made a ran for it. The queue for Hagrids was 75 minutes. We got on to the ride in 20 minutes. 😊 We ran across the way before picking up our bags to get our icecream and beer… grabbed out stuff and spent the last 20 minutes of the park’s opening on the bridge to Jurassic Park looking out to Hogwarts enjoying the last few moments of our vacation.  Summary: All in all – to us, the Non-private VIP Experience was WELL PACED… we got lucky with our group (our group was saying the same). We all made it fun for eachother – and Dave was excellent. He knew his stuff, catered to the liking of the group – and just made it fun. Walking onto 12 rides without rushing like my wife and I rode 17 rides and ran like crazy people the day before and were exhausted Thursday… this was the perfect ending to our much needed vacation. Again, I paid 511 with tax for 2 people, but this cost DOES vary depending on day and time of year, so pay attention. Would I do it again? For this price? Maybe… higher… no – I’ve already done the VIP tour. 😊  I give this experience a 5/5 or 10/10 depending on which scale you prefer! It is definitely a thing you should do at least once if you can afford it or justify it. My biggest tip, kindly request to be with people around the same age and like minded about rides and it would increase the fun factor of your day!  Huge thank you to the group and to Dave for making this an amazing experience!  I hope you all are as blessed as my wife and I were during this trip! Looking forward to the next one! — with Kamila Ferreira Gerber at Universal Orlando Resort.",Universal Studios Florida
Lindsey K,5.0," February 27, 2021",Fantastic Customer Service!,"I've been a Passholder for about two years now going on three and I always have a fantastic time going to the parks. Since reopening after the pandemic, I've observed staff trying their absolute best to explain things to guests to keep them informed while directing them and still maintaining a Professional and Courteous atmosphere. Under stressful times and dealing with a good ordeal of new rules and procedures both for the guests and the staff, including masks, I've noticed the staff stepping up to the plate to not only do that but to continue to have upbeat and positive attitudes by and large across both main parks. I've had conversations with various staff at length and each time I could actually hear the smile beneath their mask. I'll continue to promote and speak highly of the parks to others due to this and look forward to many more years to come of being a Passholder!",Universal Studios Florida
Rodney A,4.0," February 23, 2021",Good times,I love the changes in architecture and feel as you move through the park. Each section feels unique. The park is very clean and most of the staff are very friendly.,Universal Studios Florida
Chris,1.0," February 22, 2021",No regard for your safety,Went to both Disney and universal on this trip and I thought there was really no comparison. At Disney there was reduced capacity and staff who enforced the social distancing and mask policies. At universal that was non-existent. Most of the staff are teenagers and you see them so far in between that they have no control over the crowds. I had people on top of me on line without a mask for over an hour coughing away and they never got kicked out. People cutting in lines and cursing at each other on top of the drunk people made it a pretty terrible experience. Glad I made Disney my vacation and universal a side attraction.,Universal Studios Florida
HeliusC,5.0," February 21, 2021",Great experience,"First time at a big theme park during COVID. Universal has set some incredible protocols and I felt safe in the resort.

SmitMLS1,5.0," February 21, 2021",Enjoyable experience,"We visited Universal/Islands of Adventure February 12,13,14, 2021. This was a busy time with Valentines and President’s Day weekend. Two of those days, the park was at capacity. In order for us to go to the other park, we had to either take the train or the walkway over. You could not leave otherwise you might not be able to get back in.  What I love the most about Universal is, with a paid hopper pass admission, you are permitted to do every attraction that both these parks offer. (Unlike Disney’s Hollywood Studio’s virtual queue disaster) I’ll save that experience for THEIR review.  We haven’t been to Universal since 2012. So much has changed since then. I’ll be honest, I really do miss the classics there., Jaws, Disaster, Back to the Future. I understand the need to update and keep it fresh. The Harry Potter attractions where absolutely AMAZING. They paid attention to every single detail. Incredible! We appreciate the safety measures taken during these Covid times however, the dividers on the Kong ride prevent you from experiencing the full 3-D effect of the attraction. Hopefully in the future they will remove them.  We had a great time at both parks . We were thankful Florida is open for business! When we returned home I went on the Universal Studios Hollywood site to compare the attractions. Surprised to see they were not even open for business yet. Thank you Orlando, Florida.  We paid roughly $1,100. for our tickets (family of 4) These tickets were good for for a 5 day hooper. You definitely get the biggest bang for your buck here. If I had done it all over again, I would’ve paid a little more for the season pass which would allow you to stay on site at a 30% discount. Staying on site at their specific hotels also get you express passes! I will certainly do this next time for sure.  Just a tip for those planning to go. You will appreciate not having to wait in line.",Universal Studios Florida
Steve R,3.0," February 19, 2021",Entrance is a mess,"We went during COVID and temperature check line BEFORE the line to get through security before the line to get into the park, was an absolute mess. People were cutting in line. There were fights. Just no control. It really put a frown on our face before even getting into the park. Once inside, the lines seem crazy long but that is due to social distancing. They move at a good speed.",Universal Studios Florida
ericoftheeeast,4.0," February 19, 2021","Good experience, park did a pretty good job with policing for COVID compliance","I (Dad) took my two teenage daughters there in February 2021. Rides were quite impressive, even for an adult. Harry Potter was their primary draw and it was very well done. Most of the guests did a pretty good job with mask compliance, and with staying 6' apart in ride lines. However, out and about, especially in Harry Potter areas it was a packed. So if you are cautious (mask compliance, wash hands often, sanitize often) and in good health, then COVID may be a perk for going to Universal Studios for I have heard that it is always crowded during winter/ spring breaks. If you are not in the best of health or immune compromised, or think you will feel too anxious with the crowds, then you may want to wait until we have a better handle in COVID. Highly recommend Express Pass. It came as part of our hotel package and was well worth it. Lines got to 60- 120 minutes long on the weekends.",Universal Studios Florida

Jennifer J,5.0," February 17, 2021",Husband was pleasantly surprised,"This was the first theme park we visited on our Orlando trip. We are a family of 3 with a 4 year old daughter. I had been when I was a kid but that was over 30 years ago and my husband has never been.  When you first walk into the park, there's a huge food court before you have to show your ticket. The restaurants all seemed to stay pretty busy so be prepared to wait a little bit for your food. There are some restaurants on the Universal app with mobile order available although I did not use that part of the app.  During our visit there was a Marti Gras theme so that was cool to see the floats on display and staff dressed up and throwing out beads to adults and kids alike.  Some of the things I wish I knew before going to the park...  1. I would highly recommend purchasing the Express pass in advance. We had no idea what this was. Basically you can buy the Express pass which allows you to go into a separate lane and minimize your wait times. At one point we saw at least 4 groups of Express pass people go before our line moved. It was a little angering. I looked into the purchasing the Express pass but it was too late because they were all sold out.  2. I had no clue what a virtual line was. They way it works is that you use the Universal app to find rides with a virtual line. You click on the virtual line and it gives you a window of about 30 minutes. Pick the window you want and you are ""in line"" virtually so all you do is show up within the window you signed up for. For me, it was about 4pm and I picked a 6:10-6:40 window. We signed up for the Mummy virtual line and was only in the physical line for about 15 minutes. It was so cool!  3. What the heck is child swap? I saw signs for that and finally learned that if you have a kid who isn't tall enough, both parents can stand in line with the kid. Once it's time to get on the ride, one parent goes on the ride while the other parent stays with the kid. Then the parent on the ride will get off and stay with the kid while the other parent rides the ride. It's nice so that the whole family can stay together.  4. I'd recommend having a poncho on hand before entering the park just in case a rain shower passes over during your visit. This happened to us and the rain only lasted about an hour. The rest of the day was beautiful.  5. Use the Universal app to see the wait times for each of the rides. The rides can have long wait times but we stayed until the park closed at 8pm. The lines are much shorter towards the end of the day so we were able to hop on the Mummy Ride and the Transformers Ride before we left. They were so awesome. My husband could not believe how cool they were. My daughter was able to ride Transformers and loved it.  6. Don't forget to bring an external battery charger for your phone. If you do forget, you can buy a fuel cell which is already charged for $30. I was stressed out about running out of juice on my phone later in the day and scaled back on using the app and taking pictures until I was able to get the phone charged up.",Universal Studios Florida
Diane M,1.0," February 17, 2021",Wish it was a better experience ...,"Unfortunately we wish we would have done something else with our day. Long lines- two hour waits (we didn’t pay extra for express pass) for rides. In 9 hours (and $400 plus for three people) we experienced two “rides”. Loved the Harry Potter area and the butter beer- some rides were “at capacity” and so we were turned away after waiting in line??? Even with long long long lines.  To be successful at Universal and see everything - you need to pay more to get the express tickets.  Rides were socially distant - lots of “hall monitors” who were reminding people about mask wearing at all times. People seen cleaning but without limiting access to the park overall- it just made lines longer and longer with socially distant rides.  At least the weather got better - after it poured with heavy rain that morning- but overall a waste of time and money.

Jeff G,1.0," February 7, 2021",Bad customer service and bad policy.,"Very bad how they handled within the pandemic season pass holders. Three months extension during a pandemic is ridiculous. Enjoyed the parks for my kids while I was there, but they ripped me and my family off.",Universal Studios Florida
David T,1.0," February 7, 2021",Season pass holders got ripped during pandemic,"Here is what I have to say to Universal studios: You have a couple of nice parks, but you customer service and policies suck at the worst level. I bought our family season pass and then the pandemic hit. Okay, I understand, not their fault. They operantly closed for 3 months and re-opened in June. If you recall, June and July corona was at its peak. We called in September and they told us they were extending our passes until January 13. That would be 3 months more than our original expiry date. So I didn't think much of it until I visited the park in October and realized NO ONE WAS THERE. The hotel we normally stay at (Gaylord Palms) was completely empty. I think out of a thousand rooms, there was probably only 10 families. I could be exaggerating a bit on that!! Nevertheless, we arrived at the park only to realize, one of the park is closed and the 2 that are open have several rides that are closed. After thinking about it some more, here is what I find so lame by how they thought they paid back to loyal season holders; 1. They should have extended to all season holders to 6 months more, not 3. 2. No one in their right mind would have visited the parks until October of 2020. No one was at their parks in June, July, August and September. The capacity was only 25% and they only reached 10% 3. One park is completely closed and still closed. 4. Not all rides in the functional parks are activated, but most (to be fair). 5. Every time I speak to them on the telephone they give you such attitude, as if I'm just a greedy guy looking for handout after paying thousands of dollars for not using their parks during the pandemic. 6. Overall; I enjoyed the parks when they were open prior to pandemic, but during the pandemic, they should have done much more for season pass holders. It wouldn't have hurt them to extend to those who paid for season pass. This way, I would have continued. Such bad business stupidity. Unless they change their ways, you will not see me buying any season tickets to this park again. I really don't recommend buying the season tickets. Sorry",Universal Studios Florida

pdk25,3.0," February 5, 2021",A good one time visit.,"I thought Universal Studios was just a ok experience. The park, however, was very clean and it looked beautiful. The park just didn't deliver the rides that I mostly like. I'm a coaster person. I did ride Rip Ride Rocket but I thought the ride experience was just sub par. Hulk and Hagrid's at Islands of Adventure are much better rides. I did like the Transformers area of the park. Themed very well. The 3-D ride there was good, but Spiderman at IoA was better in my opinion. The Men in Black ride was fun, shooting at other peoples vehicles to make them spin. We ate at a sea food place in Universal. I don't know the name of the place but it was very good. Probably the best food I have eaten in Orlando. If I knew the name of the place, I'd rate it 5 stars. Universal isn't a bad park, but it's not great either. That is the reason it earns a 3 star rating. Beware the mask police at Universal.",Universal Studios Florida

Nazi like germ control staff .....like being chased down by Harry Potter forbidden ride staff because some of the hand sanitize dripped and “you must rub it in for 30 seconds “. The shop attendant at Honey Dukes was the rudest public shop attendant I have ever seen. Luna outside was pleasant selling the butter beer. Lumbard’s seafood grill was fair but costly. Half the shows are not open but still same prize. Hours shorter but parking is $26. Help in “the unprecedented times” is not coming from Universal that is for sure.

Dr. Seuss, Betty Boop, Popeye, and many other of my favorite characters.  And, of course, we ended the day with drinks at Margaritaville.  We had no issues with any thing that day.

Dmayville,1.0," January 30, 2021",Beware Seniors,"BEWARE Seniors!  We just visited this week and we’re taken advantage of because we were seniors. We parked at Universal Studios and went into the park to visit some attractions like the Blues Brothers show, etc. first of all, we couldn’t find our way around because of the lack of maps. Secondly, we didn’t know that we were walking into the wrong park. There were so many signs, you couldn’t tell where you were going. It’s overwhelming. We ended up in the ride park (Island of Adventure). Well, I get sick in these rides. Our daughter likes Harry Potter so we went there. We didn’t realize that there’s Harry Potter in the other park too. After a few rides, we noticed that we were in the wrong park. There was little compassion at guest services. The supervisor said that they had a 20 minute wrong park policy. We were too long in one park after riding a couple of rides and having lunch. We were basically told tough luck. They could easily fix this problem by signing up for one park. We weren’t told that we were in the wrong park until we went to guest services. So for seniors, beware! While there was little explaining about the two park, they had lots of people trying to sell us the vacation experience aka timeshares. Also, beware of the offer of free money. They actually pestered us. We enjoyed Disney and SeaWorld but were very disappointed in Universal. Forget customer service as they are not helpful (Leslie). I would recommend that seniors pass on Universal.",Universal Studios Florida
Lizbeth J,1.0," January 29, 2021",Non-disclosed toxin and allergen exposure.,Masks and social distancing- ok fine but what they don’t disclose at all is you are required to allow them to squirt unknown and undisclosed ingredients into your hands before every single ride.

The Bourne Stuntacular was a very good show and would advise catching if you have the time. Not very busy during the week which was great and the weather couldn't have been more perfect. One thing I wish a lot of parks would adopt that Universal does is offer lockers for free at the rides instead of making you pay for one. You use your park ticket to rent and retrieve your items from the lockers.

Moved2Texas,2.0," January 25, 2021","Good rides, so so COVID response","I did not like the reservation system at Disney until I saw the alternative at Universal studios. During the holidays and probably beyond, Universal was operating at reduced capacity. Universal’s solution to determine who got in was first come, first served. Once capacity was reached, entry was closed which meant that we had to get there well before park opening time or our one day prepaid tickets would be worthless!!  The Good: At each attraction, staff applied hand sanitizer to all guests hands before and after the rides. There were plenty of hand sanitizing stations located around the park. The Leaky Cauldron had good food. The four-D rides such as Escape from Gringotts and transformers were fun. Once in the formally designated queue lines, social distancing was more achievable.  The Bad: Harry Potter World was a non-socially distanced mosh pit in the morning. Richters Burgers was mostly disappointing. The action in the transformers ride made one of our party nauseous with motion sickness.  The Ugly: The area between the security check and the entrance was a disorganized mess with no COVID protocols and two lines mashed together for the two separate park entrances.due to the urgency to get inside the parks before capacity was reached led to some bad crowd behavior. Fortunately we didn’t have to try to get a refund of non refundable tickets because we got in. We entered around 7:30. The park reached capacity at 8:10 AM, ten minutes past the published opening time! If we hadn’t heard that they were letting people enter early, we may not have made it in. The TV new ran stories on the rush to get in the day before we visited and warned people to get there early, which probably helped overwhelm the entry lines.  Clearly Universal was not prepared to handle crowds while trying to limit park capacity. Fortunately nobody in our party has contracted COVID in the subsequent weeks after our visit so we made it through. However we were worried about the potential exposure we faced at Universal.",Universal Studios Florida

Kudos to ride and attraction operators who also paused whatever they were doing to ask people to pull their masks up or keep their masks on during rides. Used to ride coasters more when I was younger, not so much now. 4D and 3D attractions were really good, but sometimes a bit much for me. One in particular was triggering: Jimmy Fallon's Race Through New York. If you've had a bad experience in a car crash I do not recommend it.

paul y,4.0," January 20, 2021",A little dated for the price but Potter saves it,"I remember going to Universal in LA way back in 1993 and being blown away by the Back to the Future ride and even E.T! There was a tour of the movie sets with Psycho, Earthquake, King Kong, Jaws and Moses Red Sea being on the tour. It was unique and interesting.  But poor E.T hasn't aged well and probably needs to go home permanently. The Men In Black too was easy to forget. Jurassic Park also dated. These are films from a long time ago and Universal really needs to get with the times.  Plenty of food places and shops around. Easy to navigate. But other than Potter and the dated movie rides the rest is typical theme park fodder, when maybe its appeal was once in its uniqueness.  Potter steals the show, it's not great, but it is very good. If I was between 8 and 12, it would be unforgettable. It needs expanding and focusing on because this is unique to Universal.",Universal Studios Florida
Summit Seeker,2.0," January 19, 2021",“What Happened???....”,"First off, we haven’t visited here in 7-8 yrs, so we weren’t quite sure what was left from before. We knew Jaws and King Kong had been gone for quite some time(though we don’t like it): But we didn’t know Twister, and Terminator 2 were gone as well. Now the park feels a bit bare. There are a few oldies, ET, and Men n Black, but from there it’s slim pickings. Positives here include the entire Harry Potter area, including the ride, Escape from Gringotts, and Transformers, and maybe the Hollywood Rip Ride Rocket,and Insert crickets here____! Seriously, we can not find anything else worth noting. Maybe jaws wasn’t the greatest ride universal ever had(well, actually it was), but it gave substance to that huge lake area that now feels like a big nothing, you have to walk around, to get to something. So, what’s the purpose of keeping this area, complete with a shark hanging on the dock, hanging around? Also, T2 was a at least a show/attraction that seemed to always be worth sitting through: but it’s now gone as well. And twister, which hadn’t been there that long, is gone too. This attraction was at least worth a look at as well. Now, there’s Shrek, which is terrible, and some jimmy fallon ride through Hollywood attraction, which couldn’t end quick enough. The menion mayhem was ok, but not great. And our 90 min wait for Fast n Furious, ended with the ride breaking down just before we got our chance, so.... The Escape from Gringotts was an excellent ride. The attention to detail is amazing. And though I’m not the Harry Potter fanatic, this area of the park looks realistic from the bits of the movies I’ve seen. Transformers is a well thought out attraction too, though it can make one a little motion sick if you’re not used to it. And the Rip Rocket is an ok coaster, but not as exhilarating as others we’ve ridden. Overall, we feel this is now the weaker of the 2 parks. And don’t try doing both in one day, as you’ll end up running through, trying to get from attraction to attraction, and falling short. And though the express train is a neat way to connect the park, it isn’t worth the added cost. All n all, I’d skip this park, and either spend a full day at Islands of Adventure; or head 10 miles SW to, well, you know where... sorry.",Universal Studios Florida
Hufflepuff mom,5.0," January 18, 2021",Safety first and it shows,"I just returned from a fun-filled weekend with my daughter to Orlando, Florida. I'm 100% impressed with all the safety practices they have put in place.  Everyone wears masks (and designated workers are there to remind the occasional person who slips it off). Everything is sanitized. Everyone gets hand sanitizer before getting on a ride and stations are available after the ride. Safety shields are put between ride rows or they go every other row. Everyone is standing at least 6 feet apart in every line. Everyone's temperature is screened.  I highly recommend going to Universal and Island of Adventure. They put safety first and made our experience safe and fun.",Universal Studios Florida
Bailey G,5.0," January 17, 2021",Favorite Theme Park in Orlando,"As an Orlando resident, I have to say that Universal Studios Orlando is my absolute favorite theme park!  I will disclose that my wife works here, however I have loved this theme park well before I even met her. UO is the perfect park for any movie lover. While marquis attractions have gone away and new one taken their place, the experience is top notch from start to finish.  The rides are great, always improving and finding ways to add new value to your experience. However, you have not experienced Halloween until you've gone to Halloween Horror Nights. It is always voted as one of the top Halloween events across the country ever year and for good reason. The attention to detail, the house mazes and the entire environment will leave you wanting to come back year after year.  Other amazing events they put on is Mardi Gras (my other personal favorite), Rock the Universe (so much fun for those who are religious) and Grinchmas (my wife's favorite).  Definitely make plans to stop by on your next trip!",Universal Studios Florida

They are really awesome at making sure people are wearing masks and sanitizing their hands to keep everyone safe. There are floor markers in all of the queues to make sure people stand 6 feet apart, unfortunately not all guests follow these markers and we often had people standing on top of us in line. Thankfully anytime we pointed this out to a staff member they quickly asked the people to move away from us. The staff here is great. We had an issue where we lost our Freestyle Souvenir cup on one of the rides. While retracing our steps we came across Emily at the Woody Woodpecker coaster and she was truly amazing. She checked the ride for us and when they couldn't find it she gave us great advice on what to do next. We ended up going to the nearest Food Expo where Esthere helped us get a brand new cup to replace it for free. They were both awesome and turned a bad situation in a great one for us.",Universal Studios Florida

Holly M,1.0," January 14, 2021",Mistake to visit during Covid,"I want to start by saying under normal circumstances we love Universal however it was a mistake to come during Covid. You cannot even scratch your nose for 2 sec without someone yelling at you to put your mask back on and yes I mean yelling at you they are not nice about it in the least. No one said please or thank you. They were constantly playing a recording of a reminder to wear mask and practice social distancing and the voice was that of some super strict school marm. It felt like we were in a dictatorship country were you are constantly being watched and ordered around. You could visibly tell staff was stressed and unhappy they shuffled people through like hearing cattle. There were a few exceptions to this where staff were actually friendly and acknowledged the stressful atmosphere, however this was the exception. Because I have a smart watch I tried to not bring my phone into the park since they are not allowed on some rides and I didn't want to deal with lockers, however they will not let you order food at many restaurants in the park without using the app. I went knowing things would be different and I didn't have high expectations however I guess I didn't lower them enough because I did still want to have fun and enjoy myself and it definitely did not happen.",Universal Studios Florida

The security guard would not let us in because our daughter had a shirt that had a tiny bad word on it you could hardly read unless you were focused on looking at her breasts. They would not let us turn it inside out, made us walk back to the hotel to change. When we went back into the park, music was playing with cuss words...so much for free speech. Shopped at a few stores, more profanity on shirts....i guess it’s ok to buy the stuff inside the park but don’t wear any into the park...makes total sense.  We arrived early to the park the second day and started riding the rides. Lines were not long and it was easy to get onto rides. The bathrooms were filthy and smelled. Workers were not friendly. Very rude and I never heard anyone say please or thank you. We were told thousands of times to pull our masks over our nose although my mask was stretched out from the rides it would not stay in place. Social distancing was good. Rides were fun. Lots of stuff was closed. Food that was open was gross and way overpriced. Most workers seemed to not speak much English. Not worth $700 for 4 people.",Universal Studios Florida
Shannon,4.0," January 12, 2021","fun rides, but still very busy!","My family of 4 (parents with 15 yo and 9 yo) visited Universal Orlando (Universal Studios?)the week of Dec. 27, 2020. When we heard about the capacity limits, we were a bit concerned as they were NOT taking reservations to ensure entry like the other parks. However, we made a point to get up early each day and we got into the parks each time. Once in, they did a nice job of making people wear masks, giving hand sanitizer before each ride and marking 6 ft increments for standing in lines. Even though there were capacity limits (exactly what, they won't say) we thought the park seemed very busy and lines were long. We waited an average of 50 minutes for most rides, but posted times were usually twice what we actually waited. We did not pay for express lines but could see where it would be a smart purchase.... Food lines were also very long around lunch time so we ended up eating in City Walk. My family enjoyed all the rides like the Hulk, Spiderman, The Mummy, Rip Ride Rocket, Escape from Gringotts and more. The whole Harry Potter area was very busy, but that's what's popular! One thing I wish I had known: absolutely NO items can be in your pockets for the Rip Ride Rocket. This whole ride cue was crazy each of the 3 times we rode. The line was confusing, people shouting about lockers, some warning people about the No items in your pockets, people turning back.... I was really ticked off until we figured it out. Anyway, considered yourself warned!! Otherwise, fun day!",Universal Studios Florida

They did a great job at making sure masks were on and handing out sanitizer before every ride. I specifically want to give a shout-out to Brenda who was working at the Pteradon Flyers ride. She went above and beyond to make sure both me and my husband got to switch and ride with our daughter while making sure we didn’t wait too long. Also, Pat in Harry Potter world (Diagon Alley) was fun!

They take your temperature and have social distancing signs everywhere (although most people don’t pay attention.) The girls really enjoyed the Harry Potter area and we spent more money in there for lunch and accessories. The Mummy and roller coaster were closed. The fast and furious was a 2 hour wait. Some other attractions were shorter waits, but going on 4 or 5 attractions all before noon left nothing left to do the rest of the day with so many events closed.

We ate lunch at Mels Dinner and the price was good for all the food we got.

My boyfriend and I were the only ones in a cart on of the rides so we pulled our masks down, the music of the ride stopped and we were called over the loud speaker by employees to keep our masks on, despite the fact that there was no one else riding with us. Ordering food on the app was not very convenient considering there were a lot of people on the server. Not sure why it's not safe to place an order with an actual person? When getting off the Hulk, the employees announced the ride was closed because the area was at capacity when the line was actually much shorter and less crowded than when my group was in line. Volcano Bay this past summer is much more lax with masks considering it is a water park, which begs the question: why it's safe to not wear masks there and not in the other theme parks? Drop the act. Why they're so strict for a virus that has 99.9% survival rate is beyond me. Will not go back again until things go back to normal, if ever.",Universal Studios Florida

Surprisingly it was crowded more than usual during this time last year. I see it as a good thing as it means people are ready to get on with their lives and get back to having some real fun. You have got to get in early due to capacity limits. Thank you, Universal for showing us a good time and not being a bunch of overbearing nannies.

debradefreyn,5.0," January 4, 2021",Awesome time (again),"We absolutely love Universal Orlando and come all the way from Washington state to visit. We always stay at a Loews property to get early admission and express passes - that is really the best way to go! We have stayed at Royal Pacific, the Hard Rock, and now Portofino Bay. No walk from a hotel to the parks is more than 20 mins tops - so we usually walk but have also used the boats. Boats are slower to board but you've already gotten through security and temperature checks making it sometimes a better option. The parks (Universal and Islands) are packed. I asked someone about capacity and they said it is reduced but with restaurants closed and social distancing on the rides more people are out in the main walking areas. Well, that was for sure - some areas were very crowded! But anyone saying people weren't wearing masks was somewhere else - or maybe talking about the rest areas they have where you don't have to be masked but needed to be 6 ft apart? We were there for 5 days and never saw anyone not wearing a mask. In fact, when someone (inevitably) had it below his/her nose, they were told to fix that. Some people didn't want to observe the stickers on the ground (at the rides) but usually a good long stare at them and then at the sticker would make them be more mindful. If you don't have an express pass - not sure you want to be there when the park is full. Most rides had lines of 2-3 HOURS, but with express pass you pretty much walk right up. If you are at Islands and want to ride Hagrids - you have to get a virtual pass. If you try to go at 7am and just get in line you could wait 60-90 mins. But with a virtual pass we only waited 30 mins even on the busiest days. We rode the ride 4 times and it was A BLAST. Our girls are 12 and 13 and they love Universal.

Cutting in lines (apparently they know whats about to go down). We get in the park, it was nice - stood in line for about two hours for Rip Ride Rocket (we were the first maybe 20 people in line for the ride, the ride didnt start until 9:45), Within 30 minutes of standing there the line was already at capacity and was a 3 hour wait. WTF!? We walk around, all while being on the useless Universal App, trying to find a line that didnt have 400 minute wait time. We tried the virtual queues, but those are worthless. We did manage to get on The Mummy ride around 1pm (our second ride of the day). The park has already reached capacity at 9:10am - that should have been a clue for us. We rode our 3rd ride due to the nicest employee, Alexandra. We talked with her for a bit and voiced concerns about the park (why are there so many people here, is universal over selling tickets -, she asked if there was anything she could do and we said ""could you get us on a ride, any ride?! She said OF COURSE! So we headed to Harry Potter and the Escape from Gringotts - THANK THE BABY JESUS Alexandra was there or we would have never got on the ride - it was at capacity all day.

We couldn't even make it to the park the second day because it had already reached capacity at 8:03am. It was a f**^ing joke and not the Universal Studios I remember from the early 2000's.

We purchased everything we were offered as far as Express Passes and Early entry to the parks. On day 2 of our trip we planned to enter the park at 7. Once we arrived it was obviously PACKED. Super LONG lines. We had no idea where to go and had a hard time finding an attendant to assist us. Once we did, we were told no one is getting in even with an early admission pass. ""back of the line please Sir"". So we waited. Day 3 same thing. I approached another attendant and explained we paid for early entry and were in line with people who had not yet purchased tickets. ""Back of the line Sir"". Later that night I called Universal Customer Service and explained our issue. The lady told me that the park had totally screwed up. She advised that on the next day we don't take no for an answer as she could see what we had purchased and it was everything that could be purchased. Day 4 and 5 we had to shove and push our way to the front and demand the person at the gate investigate our tickets closer. After that we were in.

I observe them reminding people from time to time. If you haven’t seen the Bourne Stuntacular, you should go see it ...my only problem with that, was the social distancing with a little off... they were social distancing along the rows ...people sitting next to you with 3 seats between parties... but there were other people sitting right in front of you and right behind you which doesn’t make sense... in all it was a great experience and I’m glad I took my family to there.",Universal Studios Florida

Not able to maintain 6feet walking through park or existing rides on peak or capacity days due to crowds they need to rethink their numbers for capacity to allow for this. On days with light crowd covid safety maintained constant. Passholder days made for higher capacity even with unlimited express ride time waits were as 2hrs or more. Days without PASSHOLDER or high capacity ride wait were less than 30min w express pass.

No ability to social distance at all. The ride ques were ok, but the park was more crowded than I’ve ever experienced it before. There were rides we were never even able to get on because some of the lines were up to 3 hours or closed because they “reached capacity.” If I could somehow get my money back I totally would. What a waste! We should’ve spent an extra day at Disney instead. Disney is doing things well in the parks!",Universal Studios Florida
Keith H,5.0," December 31, 2020",Lots of fun for the whole family!,Spent a few days here with my 15 year old twins. The only complaint they had was sore feet from going all day long. Theres no shortage of things to do here. Tip: Stay on the resort property and get express passes. Makes life a lot easier. Enjoy,Universal Studios Florida
Daria S,1.0," December 30, 2020",COVID health hazard - not worth the money or risk!!!!,"My family interrupted our Disney vacation to spend the day at Universal Islands of Adventure. First of all, the ticket prices were exorbitant and after spending the day there, totally not worth the price of admission. Arriving around 8:20, parks were already “at capacity”. Upon admission to the park I’m not sure what their capacity is because it seemed much more than 30-35%. People were shoulder to shoulder. Little to no social distancing. People not wearing masks properly. Many people in lines and walking around with masks down on chins, eating and drinking food while in lines and walking around. Staff not doing anything to correct violations. All virtual queues were filled throughout the day. The only positive was that queues moved faster than the wait times listed but still waited a minimum of one hour or more for each ride. My family and I felt so incredibly uncomfortable the entire day and didn’t leave because we spent over $500 for one day tickets. I am so regretful that I didn’t read reviews prior to going and pray my family doesn’t get COVID after this experience. The two prior days we spent at Disney and it was a polar opposite experience. Disney clearly values its patrons’ health, safety and overall customer experience so much more than Universal. Bottom line, I don’t recommend going to Universal if you value your health and wallet!!!!! I would give zero stars if I could. Universal executives- maybe you should spend a day at Disney to get a lesson how things should be run!!!!! You should be ashamed of stealing people’s money for the experience you’re delivering.",Universal Studios Florida
julie g,1.0," December 30, 2020",Has anyone here researched the CDC guidelines?,"In the hopes that Universal was heeding advice from the CDC much like Disney properties were, we visited Universal after Christmas. The parks were both filled fuller than I’ve ever seen them filled and social distancing was a joke. It just wasn’t even possible to socially distance in the thoroughfares. The “virtual line” system was a failure as spots were released four times a day and at those times each day, the app platform was frequently overloaded and non functional. The order ahead option for food was also a joke- great that you get to order ahead on an app- but it fails when universal execs don’t staff food centers to handle those app orders- wait times were crazy and staff were obviously overworked. The whole experience was awful- but hey- at least universal is making bank during covid",Universal Studios Florida
George,3.0," December 30, 2020",Rides open. Food good. Service and management needs improvement. Try elsewhere.,"The good. Almost all rides and shows were open and operational. The food at the table service restaurants in the parks is EXCELLENT. Holiday hours kept the parks open till 10pm. They did extend one of our tickets to a later date due to park capacity.  The bad. Universal Studios does not have an advanced reservation system for park entry. This is odd considering the fact that many smaller amusement parks do have this. Basically, this results in a mad rush in the morning in attempt to gain entry to the park before it reaches capacity. We went for four days. The park opened at 8AM. One day we arrived at 10AM and were denied entry due to park capacity. This left us with nothing to do on one day of our vacation. Although they did give us a replacement ticket for a later date, the process for obtaining it was cumbersome. First, I attempted to call guest services where I waited on hold for 40 minutes with no one answering, then we waited in line at guest services for an hour before a representative saw us and give us the ticket. When we were given the replacement ticket, no one could print out a confirmation of this for my records. We were told it’s “stored in their system” and that I could call their 1-800 number to get a confirmation emailed to me. When I called the number, the first agent gave me inaccurate info and I had to call back. After being on the phone for half an hour on the second call, I was finally able to get someone to generate an email and send it to me. Regarding covid… We aren’t particularly scared of covid, but if you are, you should know that the park was packed. Lines for rides were regularly 2+ hr wait. Although they did have markers in the lines for social distancing, it was rare to be six feet away from other guests. In fact, we were often shoulder to shoulder with other guests whether we wanted to be or not. The line for food was an hour or more at the majority of dining locations during much of the day. Probably my biggest concern was around the behavior of some staff members. They require you to use hand sanitizer at every ride. At one ride, a staff member accused me of not taking it, then proceeded to get in an argument with me and call me a liar in front of an entire line of guests. Overall, I would probably try a different park chain next time.",Universal Studios Florida
Pam S,1.0," December 30, 2020",Disappointed,"It’s a racket. Pay your parking pass and then be told they are at capacity and don’t refund your money. They sure are doing more than capacity. Very disappointed in the way they are doing business. Ridiculous!,!!",Universal Studios Florida

Maria D,1.0," December 30, 2020",Terrible on multiple levels,"My family and I spent 8 long, miserable hours there yesterday, and I see it as a public service responsibility to share our experience. This park over books, which results in multiple rides closing their lines at a time due to having reached ‘capacity.’ As a result they suggest people go on their app and monitor wait times, which do nothing to let you know when the lines will re-open. When we asked for a solution to that problem, they suggested we reserve a time to return through the ‘virtual’ feature on their app. When we tried to do that the app told us that all of the virtual spots gad been filled. When we asked how to fix that issue, they told us that virtual spots open every 2 hours, on the exact hour. So at 2 pm when the app started to take our reservation, it locked us out midway (as we were literally typing our name), saying the spot had just been taken by someone else. When we returned to the minion line to explain what happened and that we have been trying to get on this line for over 2 hours, being recognized by the ticket woman, they still said no, the supervisor (blond hair in a ponytail, blue eyes) said he would not make an exception. It did not help that we had arrived at 8:30 in the morning to purchase express passes, which by then had sold out. Adding to this, the pizza was raw, there was little social distancing monitored except in some lines, and they gave you a pea-sized squirt of sanitizer before every ride (good luck tracking down a full dispenser after). If you don’t have a problem walking a few miles glued to your phone, hoping you will get a virtual reservation after all of the best rides (Harry Potter escape from Gringotts, Minions, Mummy, and Jimmy Fallon Race through NY) close their lines, and if once you get on a line you don’t mind waiting over 2 hours, then Universal Studios may be a good match for you. For us however, the bottom line is that we rode 2 rides in 8 hours. This was a surprise Christmas gift for our kids, we had posted our anticipation all over Facebook on Christmas morning, and we left in tears with my husband having to carry our 9 year old on his shoulders she was exhausted as we all were by walking mikes to catch a ride without avail. By the end of it, Andrea at Guest Services acted as though she were doing me a favor by giving us a refund. I told her We deserved the refund *and* free express passes for this heap of nonsenses. This was the centerpiece of a $6K vacation for us, ending in apologies to our kids and more tears. Don’t go here. It’s pouring money in a drain and risking your and your family’s health and safety due to rampant COVID noncompliance.",Universal Studios Florida
fivekidsohmy1,5.0," December 30, 2020",Safe and wonderful trip!,"We came the week before Christmas and had the best time! We felt very safe with tons of sanitizer stations, temperature checks, employees there specifically to monitor mask compliance, and employees specifically there to squirt hand sanitizer onto your hands before entering a ride. There were 6 foot markers all over the park. We stayed at the Hard Rock Hotel, so we had Express Pass, which was AWESOME! We never waited more than 10 minutes for any ride except for Hagrid's. Diagon Alley is really quiet if you go the last 2 hours before closing. We appreciated that Universal still had so much to offer while Disney has cancelled so much of their entertainment (which is why we cancelled out Disney trip). The Christmas decorations were gorgeous and I just can't say enough how much we enjoyed our time at the parks. We were sad that the Grinchmas show was cancelled as well as the castle light show, but understand how crowded those areas are. We loved the Cinematic Spectacular though!",Universal Studios Florida
KNMiller,3.0," December 29, 2020",Universal... PROS and CONS,"Disclaimer: I am a die hard Disney fan. However, no land in Disney holds a candle to Diagon Alley. The detailing, immersive nature and even the entrance being designed to take you “through a wall” are second to none. So- here we are.  This rating is purely based on my experience during the pandemic. Here are the PROS, the CONS and TIPS and what to expect.  PROS: As mentioned- Diagon Alley is unparalleled. It’s just fantastic. Buy an interactive wand, it’s worth it. King’s Cross Station- again, platform 9 3/4 is just great. Get a park to park ticket if you and to take the train, and take it from both directions. Worth it.  CONS: As much as I love Diagon Alley (and I do, I REALLY do), the rest of the park is, well... MEH. Don’t get me wrong, there are a few must do’s- Bourne Show is incredible, and Minion Mayhem is great- but nothing really holds a candle to HP land... and EVERYONE knows it. If there are a hundred people in the park, 99 of them will be in Diagon Alley. Prepare for this. If it is a crowded day, DA will be absolutely packed and if you can’t see the details, you honestly miss it. Don’t just flock to Gringott’s (though this queue and ride is great). This brings me to...  WHAT TO EXPECT: COVID precautions in some areas are apparent and in other areas not. First, the positive- ride line spacing is great. Very spaced and people generally followed. Mask wearing is enforced. Sanitizer is plentiful and ride cars are spaced. However, big negative- the park advertises 35% capacity. No way. Not even close. Every ride was over 1 hour wait. Most over 2 hours. Virtual queues were worse. I’ve been to Disney on days crowds were 9 or 10. This was more crowded. I felt less exposed in a ride queue than walking on the street. Universal DOES not have reserve spots right now. This means if you buy a ticket, and show up and the park is at capacity, you cannot get in. And if you do get in, and capacity is maxed, you will wait at least an hour for EACH ride. Note- this could be because of our travel dates, yes, BUT...  TIPS: If you choose to travel now, know that Universal does not reserve tickets. You might experience low crowds OR you might be denied. If you choose to go, stay on site if possible. You not only get priority entry, you get an hour before opening- this is crucial. Use it. We arrived at the gate by 630, and inside by 7. From there, we were able to experience DA without massive crowds, and more importantly, do other things and leave before the heaviest crowds. We did not experience massive crowding or lack of distancing, but again, we went early, followed the floor markers and did just a few things per day. And left before crowding occurred.",Universal Studios Florida
Lisa N,1.0," December 29, 2020",Disappointed,"Be very careful when purchasing multiple day tickets for Universal. They are overselling during Covid.

Ronisha B,1.0," December 29, 2020",Universal scheming guests out of money.,"Do not buy tickets. Social distancing and allowing less people in the park is a lie. Universal is selling more tickets than the park has capacity for. The amount of people in the park is ridiculous and aside from mask, the park is not doing anything to keep guest safe. I attempted to go 12/29. Every adult ride had a 2-9 hour wait, while those without a virtual line were at capacity the entire day.  The virtual line is a joke. I attempted to sign up for several rides using this method. However every time I attempted to sign up. I was told the time slot was no longer available. The virtual line only allow you to attempt to check in at 11am. 2 and 3pm. All rides were “at capacity” the entire day.  Universal is scheming people out of money. Knowing the person will be unable to get into the park or unable to ride any rides, due to the extreme wait times.  I have waited 2+ hour for a ride before, but I did not have to wait an extended amount of time for every single ride. I had a wonderful time my first two times in the park in 2018 & 2019, but after this. I do not think I will be returning",Universal Studios Florida

When I asked to not yell and give me time to order she was abruptly rude and explosive. My response was simple: “this doesn’t happen at Disney”.

I would give it a 3/5 for that specifically.  However....be prepared to wait a minimum of an hour for every single ride. Went in at 9, was able to ride two rides before lunch time. Social distancing was highly enforced when waiting in line. When you exit the ride, the main common areas are out of control. You’re literally running into people because it’s so crowded. If you’re worried about COVID, you definitely don’t want to come here. Everyone has there mask on, and that’s about it.  We were willing to pay for a fast pass at its advertised base rate, but they increase the rate/day based on the demand. $190+ for a one day fast pass!?! No thanks! Virtual Lines on the app are a joke. Either it won’t let you pick a time at all or you pick a time, the app takes forever to load, and then it says the time you just clicked on isn’t available anymore. (My phone is a new, updated iPhone, so I know it’s in fine working condition)  Many of the rides are some variation of sitting in a seat and watching the action in 3D. At least Disney has more interactive, real rides; not majority screen based with 3D glasses.  We’re going to try to go back at night to see if that helps ride times go down.

Virtual lines??? Ha, no way of getting on those, even though we tried all day. And then other attractions are at full capacity. So we left and got lunch outside of universal, because if you eat there, its another hour wait. I know what you're thinking, we should have bought the express pass.

Shoulder to shoulder as you walk through the park. The only positive thing i can say is that the few attractions we were able to get on were fun, but not worth the time and money spent.

By the time we got in the park, the lines were already 100+ minute wait time. We were told to sign up for the virtual lines but those were gone in seconds. We had a disability pass. When we used the disability pass, it was fine for Gringots but when we went back for our reserved time at Fast and Furious , we were told the ride was at capacity and we’d have to come back to try again. What’s the point of reserving a time, if they’re just going to turn us away. Then, we decided to forego the disability pass and just wait in the regular line, only to be told they were only taking Express pass and Virtual Line reservations. Basically, we paid $1100 for a glorified shopping mall. Not only that but the staff was extremely rude. We had to walk around for over an hour, to find somewhere to eat that wasn’t a two hour wait. By then we were nauseous and exhausted, only to be turned away at every ride we went too. At this point we had only been there for 4 hours and miserable. Our person with a disability took their mask off as they were exiting, only to be followed by a security person, who felt the need to pretend to do their job. We went to guest services to seek a refund, only to encounter more hassle because we purchased our tickets from a military facility. The manager, Ryan, told us we’d end up owing more money than we paid for the tickets. Or we’d have to wait 16 weeks for a 3rd party to refund us our money, just to find that to be incorrect after calling whatever number HE gave us. Ryan the manager also took our tickets, saying we’re surrendering them. Now we’re in Orlando, at Christmas, with no parks to go to. Not that we’d ever step foot in there, ever again!

shannon c,3.0," December 13, 2020",It was good EXCEPT,"I was part of the Orlando meetup group. Event was from 2-12 Friday and 3-130 am Saturday.  I’m not a large guest, but i am a 6 foot 1woman athletic build. My sister in law came and she is think on her bottom half of her body with a gut. So i researched what rides would accommodate and if you are a bigger person, rides such as spider man, transformers, jimmy kimmel, Simpsons, men in black should work out. Maybe even forbidden forest. I’ve seen bigger people manage to get on the hagrids ride as well. It all depends on body type. But the before rides for sure will work. Rides like the mummy and gringotts bank,not so much.  So i took my sister in law on forbidden Journey. The guy NEIL, tall African American guy was able to get her in the ride and had her relax her arms. The second time we got on they attempted to push it down once made us get off and didn’t even tell us what was happening. So i told them we’ve rode before, they offered a test seat. I said we did test seat and rode BEFORE. They attempted it again and then made us get off again.  So i went all the way down and found Neil and told him could He help us get on because we just rode, he got my sis in law again back on the ride.  They need to teach everyone how to help larger guests get on the rides. I understand there are restrictions and body types matter but to barely help, seen so many ppl get booted off. It was sad.  And what’s crazy is for the hagrids ride? Even hagrid wouldn’t fit. I really hope down the road they consider supporting more body types, there are so many bigger people walking universal than anyone else.  On Saturday; i waited 1 hour to ride gringotts bank and the ride broke and so we were stuck on the track and eventually forced to finish the ride the opposite way of the screen which messed up the experience.  I had no issues getting on ride but was asked to do test seat for hagrids which is possible it’s standard as they did ask if it was my first time. there was a moment i thought i wouldn’t be able to ride but i was able to click in.  If i didn’t have the meet up which allowed me to ride rides after the park closed, i would of never been able to experience hagrids.the lines are socialcdistances as much as they could have been and there are a ton of single riders due to COVID so you’re waiting longer than pre COVID times I’m sure. The virtual line didn’t work most of the time i was there. The line was so long some ppl waited hours for just a 3 minute experience. The experience is amazing but such a long line it goes so deep you have never seen how far the line can go until you’ve done this ride.  The park was at capacity most of the trip so if i didn’t have the meet up, i wouldn’t of been able to do much if anything at all. Unless you stay on a resort and can experience park early you’ll be on waitlist for basically everything and walking around with barely any place to sit. It was WAY too many people there for the park to say it was safe. Harry Potter world a disaster. The biggest attraction there obviously and no social distancing could possibly be done unless you were in gringotts bank waiting to ride the ride.  So if you’re going during COVID understand if you don’t go early and plan to spend all day there you will not be able to do much.  The last time i was here pre COVID and pre hagrids ride, i was able to do at least 10-13 rides in a day and eat twice and get butter beer 4 times. and i spent most of my day at Harry Potter world and rode express back and forth.  I tried to replicate that trip and it was impossible. I was there from 2-12 am. Because again the meet up started once park closed. I was only able to do 6 rides. Even with park closed it was just so many people and there is just So much walking.  Just prepare for a minimum 3 day trip so you can at least experience every ride you want ONCE.  So i rated this 3 out of 5 due to them not accommodating body types like they need to. (Disney is better at this). For literally allowing the park to be at capacity, you can’t do shut when this occurs FYI. I was even told if i left the park(which you have to, to get to other park if you have both tickets, if you choose not to do hogwarts express which was a 2 hour wait) i wouldn’t be able to re enter which wasn’t true at all.  Train your staff better on policies and getting people to snap into their seats safely , accommodate your larger guests and stop discriminating.",Universal Studios Florida
Yvonne Gabel,5.0," December 12, 2020",Excellent experience,"It’s a lot of walking but you don’t notice it, till the end of the night. We ate dinner in the park and found everything we needed. The rides are great and if you take lift, it’s pretty easy and fast to get into the park. I’d highly recommend going in December. The Christmas decorations make it more special. It’s also less packed. I do advise an express pass if you can afford it. It’s well worth it. We stood in line to get on the train for an hour and most rides had an hour wait time. If you want to hit every ride in one day, you will need an express pass. If you can’t afford it, I suggest getting to the park before the gates open and be the first in the gate to save time. Then take a big break for a few hours during power times and eat lunch or just rest a bit, then get back in lines after 6, to hit more rides. It’s a must experience. If your a Harry Potter fan this is an AWSOME time.",Universal Studios Florida
Rebecca S,4.0," December 10, 2020",Glad We Went During Covid,"Husband and I went in November and it was mostly great. You MUST have a smartphone as almost everything is done online, ie. food ordering, restaurant reservations, checking ride wait times, etc. so make sure phones are charged and someone is good at navigating this way. Maps are not available at all. I can see where it would be frustrating without a Fastpass, but fortunately we went on days that weren't busy. In order to see all of Harry Potter world, you must go to BOTH parks but you can't ride the train unless you have a Parkhopper pass, which we didn't so that was annoying. We can't ride all the crazy coasters anymore so it was extremely frustrating, downright DISCRIMINATING that we were refused on the Pterodactyl ride because we didn't have a child with us! If it's a weight issue than post a weight limit! I know parents of kids that weigh more than we do combined. Would've sat in different seats even. Complete B.S. that only some adults get to ride! Louie's had good Italian fast food and reasonably priced. Harry Potter Forbidden Journey was the coolest ride I've ever experienced! Loved King Kong too. Purchased a dinner/movie combo online before we went and of course it's a limited menu. Antojitos was decent, loved the live entertainment! So the next night we go to use our coupon & the sandwich shop had never heard of this deal but were very nice and accepted our tickets. Then we watched Guardians of the Galaxy on the big screen. A very nice way to unwind before heading back to our hotel. Overall we had a good time but have no plans on going back. Bucket list destination, check.",Universal Studios Florida

Alicia Ludescher,4.0," December 8, 2020",Clean Bathrooms,"My husband and I are slowly but surely checking off Orlando theme parks to visit each time we are in Orlando. This year, we visited Universal Studios. My husband and I are in our twenties, and we went to the park with our friends. We enjoyed the park for about 4 hours then we were ready to go. I think with smaller children there are more attractions to visit plus during the pandemic many attractions were limited, or not even open. We entered the park right at opening and went straight for Gringotts which I highly recommend. There was hardly a line and this ride is awesome. I wasn't a Harry Potter fan until after this ride and wandering around Diagon Alley. The Transformers attraction was also a good time. We didn't make it on the Minion ride because of the line, but if I visit again, that would be a must. I am very impressed with the cleanliness of the park, especially during the pandemic. The bathrooms were remarkably clean for the number of people frequenting the park daily.",Universal Studios Florida
Erika Garcia,5.0," December 8, 2020",Amazing!,"Go here if you’re in Orlando! We had to take some crazy timeshare tour by Westgate to get a discount on our tickets but after saying no 100x to the person trying to get us to get the timeshare we were on our way. Universal itself is amazing! So beautiful and definitely do Citywalk! The drinks, the food, the atmosphere is awesome!! Voodoo doughnuts was so good! Unfortunately hardly any of the Harry Potter rides were open on the Universal Orlando side but the one that was open was sooo good! I’m terrified of coasters but I would do it again! Had an awesome time here.",Universal Studios Florida
K. T,4.0," December 6, 2020",Safe visit,Let me begin by saying they should keep the safety measurements in place post Covid-19.  Hand sanitizer everywhere.  Staff holding sign to remind you to wear your mask and to wear it properly.  Blue ground markings to remind you to social distance.  Temperature taken prior to park entry.  Small wait times.  The most crowded area was Harry Potter area.,Universal Studios Florida
Ron F,5.0," December 5, 2020",Safe and fun,They are doing a great job with make visitors/guests fell safe! I can't wait to bring the kids back! 11/29/20 - 12/02/20 very low attendance.,Universal Studios Florida
Kerry B,3.0," December 4, 2020",Some parts okay others super crowded,"I was extremely impressed when I first got to Universal! We were staying on the property and I liked how our temperature was taken daily before we could get on the bus to the parks. The bus limited capacity and mandated masks which made us feel quite comfortable. When you got to the park hand sanitizer stations were abundant as well as signage stating social distancing and mask rules. Lines were kept spread apart and aside from a few people who couldn’t follow those directions (which I quickly told to back up) most people abided by them.  Then came Harry Potter world. What a DISASTER. It was crowded, there was no social distancing unless it was in a line, and the only sign that there was a pandemic was that people were wearing face masks. Luckily we got early admission into the park by staying on property so we were able to bop on a couple HP rides before the gobs of people swarmed in. After 10am hit we left that part of the park simply for fear of being around so many people. No one was enforcing distancing which, I get, can be a near impossible task, but something more needed to be done. Maybe if the capacity into HP world itself was limited and virtual lines were always in effect it would have some crowd control. I really wanted to enjoy diagon alley, but since that park didn’t have early admission during the week we were barely able to. There were just too many people to feel safe there. It was so unfortunate.  We wound up cutting our trip short by 2 days because the weekend was coming and it was getting crowded. We left today (supposed to leave Monday) - went to the park for the early admission, changed our flight, and flew home. Today the lines were insane just to get into the park. There was a noted difference between early and general admission, albeit smaller today (Friday) than Wednesday and Thursday. As soon as the park opened for general admission it was like a wall of people went dashing for HP world. Seriously though, there was a roped off section by Dr Seuss landing and there was a giant crowd of people not following social distancing protocols AT ALL. Once 10am hit they swarmed in, some running, to get in line. It was crazy. I was so disappointed by that. I get it, Harry Potter is a money maker for the park, but allowing that many people to congregate in one small space is just ridiculous. Luckily we went during the week for the first part of our trip or I would not have lasted one day.  All in all we felt safe when we were in lines and walking around the park as long as it was during the hour of early admission or not in Harry Potter world. I sanitized on my own at the lockers before and after the rides and when sanitizer was given to me prior to boarding. It was, on average, 4 sanitizes per ride experience (3 of which were my own doing at park provided stations). So. Much. Sanitizer. When possible I would find a bathroom that was off the beaten path to go wash my hands the old fashion way. In bathrooms located in high traffic areas it was, for lack of a better saying, a sh*t show. There were people at every sink and hand dryer shoulder to shoulder. It was crazy. If you go, find a more secluded spot to relieve yourself and wash your hands.  Most of the staff did a good job making sure people were wearing masks properly, however, there were still several people wearing them under their nose.  Before we went I watched a ton of videos of people in the park but I guess I didn’t research enough inside Harry Potter world because that probably would have changed my mind.",Universal Studios Florida
Zak,1.0," December 4, 2020",Universal bad dining experience,"Purchased a meal deal at citywalk and went to margaritaville. Worst decision I've ever made in my life. Waiter snatched my ticket from my table and never gave me my diet coke I asked 3 times for. Flagged down another waiter.  Very unpleased, waiter left a bad taste in my mouth.",Universal Studios Florida
Jclements75,5.0," December 3, 2020",So glad we went!,Universal did an amazing job during this pandemic. The park was very clean. Everyone wore masks. We stayed on property which made it very convenient for kids to get to the parks.,Universal Studios Florida
Raegan L,5.0," December 2, 2020",My Choice for Theme Parks,"Absolutely adore this place! Universal Parks are definitely my theme park of choice in Orlando area. Harry Potter world is just incredible, especially Diagonal Alley that’s in this specific park. It’s jaw-dropping, literally feels like you’ve been teleported into the movie. The Escape to Gringotts ride is a great ride too. The Mummy and Rip Ride Rockit are my other favorites, just great classic roller coasters with a little added touch. Men in Black is fun to get a change of pace and go shoot down some aliens. There are a bunch of fun virtual rides like the Minion ride, Transformers, Fast and Furious, Simpsons, Shrek and more. The ET ride, hidden at the way back is super cute too and a great one for the kiddos. They also have constant shows being performed and different movie characters walking around taking pictures and interacting with people. Covid-wise I feel that they have done a great job being organized and taking needed measures. If you aren’t wearing your mask properly they are sure to politely correct you. Social distancing in lines and on rides they make sure to separate each party. They also have “U Rest” areas where you can go sit and take your mask off and get a break from it, I think that’s super considerate and I definitely used those areas a few times in my visits. I just love Universal, even though everything is overpriced (like all theme parks) the experience is always worth it and such a great time.",Universal Studios Florida
SamSonNight,2.0," December 1, 2020",So expensive,"Family of 5 (two adults, 8, 6 & 6) about $750 spent for one day ($657 +/- on tickets alone)  We were hoping to get the Veteran’s/Military discount but that doesn’t apply on Tuesdays.  Wow. What a disappointment.  Dede was working ET and was rude to my husband and 8-year-old son when the ride broke down today (Dec. 1). We were next in line to ride and got held up a while.  We couldn’t find a paper maps anywhere so we were looking down at our phones the whole time trying to get everything situated. Ordering food at one of the restaurants was very frustrating because it was done through the app.  We accidentally went past the time limit on the free lockers and had to pay about $30 extra for all of us. That just soured the experience—because everything was soooooooo expensive—we felt very nickeled and dimed for everything. And for what we paid, it was disappointing.  And for the kids and gift shops—most everything was $10+. There was a pair of plastic Minion glasses for $16 😱 and you can get a package of boys underwear (5 pairs) for $26!!! The same stuff they sell at Walmart!!!!  I know the prices are going to be marked up but it is just an exorbitant amount.  Please lower your prices so more families’ pockets won’t be pinched so bad and more kids can enjoy the parks!",Universal Studios Florida
Jenna S,1.0," November 30, 2020",Discriminated against because I don't have a fast smartphone,"Due to the new ""virtual line"" you will be discriminated against if you do not have a smartphone. Basically the people who are the richest with the fastest phone are the only ones that will be able to ride the new Hagrid ride. We talked to a family in line who all had the new Iphones and they were able to go on the ride multiple times because they reserved spots for their whole family on their different phones. Meanwhile I've gone to the park, paid for parking every time, and haven't been able to go on (I do have a smartphone, it's just not a very expensive fast one). If you call to give a review they say the best they can do is tell you is to go during the week (impossible for working families, I'm a teacher), get there early (I've done this every weekend I've gone), and keep refreshing the app (really takes away from the fun of universal to have to be staring at your phone constantly refreshing, just for you to never be able to get on the ride). I've been to Universal/IOA 5 times since this ride open and still have never been able to ride this ride because of the ""Virtual line"". I've had to pay $26 every time for parking, but if you tell Universal that their only option is ""pay us more money for a more expensive pass that includes parking, then you can come up here more often, but you still may not get on the ride"" I don't mind waiting 2+ hours to ride a ride I really want to ride. It's absolutely heartbreaking to not be able to get on the ride because your poor and don't have a good enough phone so they won't let you even get in line.  I called guest services to try to understand better how the line works and the lady I spoke to Mikayla was so rude, in the middle of me talking about my experience she cut me off and said ""Well if you let me finish I can tell you my tips (what I listed above)"" Basically she didn't want to hear any feedback about the park, only read a script she is told to read to the customers. I asked to speak to someone else and she said she is capable of getting my message to others. I don't know how she plans to do that since she wouldn't even listen to my experience. I always loved Universal, but there current virtual line system, rude employees (some are very nice, but some are extremely rude), and lack of customer service (they used to be much better).",Universal Studios Florida
