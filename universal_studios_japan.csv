Star,5.0," May 27, 2021",日本你有參考資料同相片,日本是一個藝術的國家之一，東京到大阪建築文物帶出了日本的風格寺廟方面較為熱門重點壯觀美麗外表，奪目金色還有不同寺廟也帶出各有特色城市建築較為規律也帶出繁華日本另一面．東京日本各有特色美食非常吸引難忘的回憶個人意見提供參考Starchan Japan is one of the countries of art. The architectural relics from Tokyo to Osaka bring out the Japanese style. The local aspect focuses on the beautiful appearance. The dazzling gold and the differences also bring out the distinctive urban architecture. More regularity and prosperity The other side of Japan. Tokyo and Japan’s unique cuisines are very attractive for unforgettable memories. Personal opinions are provided for reference Starchan,Universal Studios Japan
Marcello M,1.0," April 5, 2021",値段が高い,too expensive and nothing special。i had to throw in the rubbish my bentou and i had to buy the expensive food of the park. This is crazy!,Universal Studios Japan
mistermark8,5.0," February 21, 2021","smaller than the US counterparts, great experience, and good food.","Love USJ! There's something they do different than other parks. All the staff is very kind and the merchandise is quite unique to this location. Recommend for friends, family, and must ride the dinosaur coaster.",Universal Studios Japan
Thea,5.0," December 7, 2020",Great Place!,"We went to USJ without purchasing any tickets beforehand, it took us less than 5 mins to purchase tickets. We went last Oct 2019 (not 2020), it was Halloween season. The theme of the place was halloween inspired. The lights, decorations, even Hello Kitty was dressed in a sppoky outfit, at night zombies will chase you,  Side note: Don't bring outside food because our food got confiscated at the entrance :(",Universal Studios Japan
Lisa,4.0," November 18, 2020",Once is e ought.,"I buy the annual pass each year and I wonder why. You go 3 times, it becomes cost effective. I never want to go more than that in one year.",Universal Studios Japan
jovinnnnn,5.0," November 18, 2020",Express Pass Recommended,"We bought our tickets through KKday for easy access via QRCode E-Ticket while we purchased our Express Passes direct from USJ's website as it was cheaper compared to packages sold from agencies. However, do note that the whole web page is in Japanese and would require and account and translation to complete the transaction.  Definitely a whole day or two would be required to complete all the attractions in the park with an express pass. We were in the park from opening till closing and although we purchased the Express 7, we did not get to complete 4-5 main attractions due to the queue.  We queued 90-105min for The Flying Dinosaur hence, it would be best to plan accordingly to fully utilized the time spent. Main attractions to visit would be The Wizarding World of Harry Potter, Jurassic Park, Minion Park and Hollywood the Ride! Terminator 2 3-D attraction was presented in Japanese only to our dismay hence, we got bored halfway through it.  Would definitely come back again to experience Super Nintendo World in 2021! :D",Universal Studios Japan
The Eating Ashman,4.0," November 1, 2020",Super full day at Universal Studios Japan osaka,"This was for my sons 10th birthday and my wife is also a pretty big Harry Potter fan. So the The Wizarding World of Harry Potter was the main reason that we went but there was plenty of other things to do and see. The rides we enjoyed were: Despicable Me Minion Mayhem, Harry Potter and the Forbidden Journey and Flight of the Hippogriff and Jurassic Park the ride (the last 2 were actual roller coaster rides, the other were 3D/4D rides). All of there were lots of fun but I prefer the actual rides to the 3D/4D rides. Make sure you get some Butterbeer - it tastes awesome. Also another tip is to go early or late for lunch as there can be a bit of a wait (also depending on where you go it can be a little expensive) Over all a fun filled, exhausting day that the whole family enjoyed",Universal Studios Japan
Joel S,5.0," October 24, 2020",Way better than Tokyo Disney!,The experience was the best we have had at an park attraction. So many cool rides and Harry Potter was out of this world...I'd pay just if it was only that section.,Universal Studios Japan
Alfie,4.0," October 22, 2020",Theme park trip,I liked it here because of the sun at lost here. The Japanese have a great sense of humour and mischief. I felt very safe.,Universal Studios Japan
Mawar M.S,5.0," October 5, 2020",Unforgettable moments,All i have felt was great. Fantastic. So happy and highly recommended. All ride so amazing. Minions. Harry potter. Spiderman. Jaws. The Flying Dinosour is very best. All protocol for safety.. i love it very much. Oh ya.. i just knew.. that u cant use your tripod here.. The location is near to station. Many thing to do here. Unforgettable moments. Its good if just solo traveller here.,Universal Studios Japan
pierreinasia,1.0," August 5, 2020",They won't let you bring in water.,"Knowing how incredibly annoying japanese people can get when it comes to dumbly applying rules, I read them carefully in both English and Japanese the day before going to avoid any problem. Alas, they still managed to find something to nitpick about in my bag : my bottle of water, which apparently was oversized (no joke -,-). So they took it and thanks to them I got a heatstroke. I contacted the customer service but they don't care. Great. Never going there again.",Universal Studios Japan
GroovyM,5.0," July 13, 2020",Everyone was very Friendly,"We live in Kansai and were able to visit in July 2020 during the restricted entry for local residents. We went on a weekday and there were no lines or large crowds. Everyone of the USJ staff was very happy and friendly. It was remarkable and added to the fun experience. **TIP** Download the USJ app on Android or iPhone. The map feature is excellent, you can save favorites and there is real-time information about wait times for the attractions. The Harry Potter Journey was incredible. It did make me dizzy and nauseous afterwords however. Overall it was a very fun day and we were able to see/do everything we wanted in about 5 hours because there were no lines or wait times for any of the attractions or restaurants.",Universal Studios Japan
StripeyMiata,4.0," June 26, 2020","For our USA fans, they still have the JAWS ride","A great day out, lots of unique things you never seen in USA parks like Sesame Street, Peanuts & Hello Kitty",Universal Studios Japan
Glee Peters,5.0," June 3, 2020",Loved Every Corner of USJ,"My favorite part of my experience is the Harry Potter ride experience. but i think, every part that i visited i have enjoyed a lot. i got back being a kid again hahaha. Though you have to be hungry walking the entire area. it is worth all your time.",Universal Studios Japan
Kim Sumin,5.0," May 28, 2020",USJ is really fantastic!,"There are various zones such as Harry Poter, Minion, Spider-Man, Jaws and Jurassic Park, and there are so many rides available for various age groups. The most interesting ride for me was The Flying dinosaur, but the waiting line was really long, so I was sad. If you buy Express Pass, you don't have to line up, but it's expensive. Therefore, To wait less I recommend waiting in one person line even if you have a party. And I recommend you to go for popular attractions like Harry Potter first. It was so much fun that I wanted to go to osaka every time. If you go to Osaka, please go to Universal Studios:)",Universal Studios Japan
Unknown,5.0," May 6, 2020",So much fun,"I went there in the late Morning and i spent the whole day there as its fun. There are different sections for different ages like the harry potter rides , the minion rides etc.",Universal Studios Japan
Hawks2theSuperBowl,5.0," April 9, 2020","In between Hollywood and Orlando, but the lines are INSANE","We’re frequent visitors to the Hollywood and Orlando Universal Studios locations, and I would rank Osaka below Orlando and well above Hollywood.  As is the case with everywhere in Japan, the Osaka universal studios is extremely clean. The rides are solid to great, with the highlights being Flying Dinosaur and the Hollywood Dream ride. As a huge theme park fan, I can say unequivocally that the Flying Dinosaur is one of my favorite rides of all time. The Hollywood Dream ride isn’t a majorly thrilling rollercoaster, though it’s definitely fun and a really smooth ride.  Keep in mind, the lines for most rides are absolutely freaking ridiculous. There was a temporary VR Neon Genesis ride while we were there (it was mediocre, though I guess if you’re a fan of the cartoon then it would be cool), and the wait was almost four hours long.  As such, I HIGHLY suggest getting an Express pass. Be aware that it’s different than the pass at Universal Studios Hollywood, as you’re only able to choose between several bundles of rides whose lines you can cut. That said, it’s absolutely worth it and pretty much required if you want to ride more than a few rides. (10/2018)",Universal Studios Japan
Ken Ip,5.0," March 19, 2020",USJ is so much fun,"I've been to USJ three time with my family already. We just love this place! It's so much fun. Our favourites are Harry Potter, Jaws, Waterworld, Jurassic World, Terminator, Spiderman, and more. Only downside of course are the long lines. Getting fast pass is very expensive especially for a family of four. So we put up with the waiting and can't always get in all the rides that we want to in a single day. That's why we have been here 3 different times!",Universal Studios Japan
Oliver Curtis,5.0," March 17, 2020",The best theme park ever 🎢🎢🎢,"The rides where great and the Spiderman ride is definitely good for anyone (adult or child ) great area for your kids and the Harry potter ride is a must do though make sure to pay extra for fast tracks on the jaws , Harry potter rides , Spiderman and jurrasic park because the queen's can get very long . The food is amazing serving western and Japanese food and definitely try the matcha ice cream but the best part is the parade but if you want to get to the subway station quicker and go to the gift shop miss out the last bit of the parade as it can get quite claustrophobic in the shop or subway.  This is the best theme park ever and a must do for Osaka",Universal Studios Japan
Dzulhilmi Zulkifli,5.0," March 9, 2020",Great to spend your day with family,"Your Osaka trip is not complete if you not coming to amazing place. Great rides, great game and movie. The environment is just like the movie!!",Universal Studios Japan
Dzulhilmi Zulkifli,5.0," March 9, 2020",Very fun and i am enjoying all the attractive ride,"i have been there last week. since i purchased 1day unlimited pas and express pass, i can enjoy almost all the games. i manage to enter Harry Potter ride 2 times!! Value for money. guys, if u really want to try harry potter game, please go the ASAP, when the gate is open",Universal Studios Japan
Jennifer T,5.0," March 6, 2020",Very fun place!,We really enjoyed our time here! We rode the Fying Dinosaur and other rides - harry potter and other 4D rides. Hope we can come back!,Universal Studios Japan
EmilChana,5.0," March 5, 2020",Simply A Must,"When considering going to Japan, you should put Osaka in the travel itineraries, and one full day to visit Universal Studios Japan. Especially if you or your kid is a Harry Potter fan.",Universal Studios Japan
LanZ,3.0," March 4, 2020",Did not get through a lot with our kids in wet weather. Ok visit.,"On a weekday, took almost 5 & 7 year olds, arriving at 11amish. Bought tix at gate (had trouble online) which was quick (5 mins) and left the park at 7pm. Regretted not buying the express passes (for 3/5 rides) as we spent 45 mins + waiting for most rides and zig zagged the park a fair bit to try catch events at the times they were on. Missed out on a fair bit even though we had a plan. It also began to rain from around 3pm and never stopped so the fireworks and parade were cancelled with nothing to replace either except for a few actors (maybe 6) dressed in colourful outfits standing in a line waving at visitors. This is completely underwhelming and needs improvement.  The Cool Japan shows/attractions had a decent area and close to park entry but we didn’t visit as we had other priorities for our kids age interest.  Harry Potter land is amazing and looks so magical. Didn’t have timed entry in mid March. A definite highlight even though our kids haven’t yet read or watched any. Magical Nights light show was great. The Wand Studies was a waste of time unless you have it to waste and was definitely a cheesy push to send people through the wand shop which looked amazing but wand prices were bananas at 50 a pop. Zipped through the castle due lack of time. Missed the ride due to long queue in rain and kids too small for roller coaster.  Kids loved the Water World performance  Sesame st 4D movie was great and the only movie we were able to catch due time/location  Minions and Spider-Man rides were excellent for all of us. Jurassic Park scared our almost 7 more than our younger kid as he hated the steep drop. Be prepared to get wet.  Disappointments: -Queues were long for non peak time & minimal or no entertainment offered. Some shows/rides had time consuming pre show/ride sections which were just average and need reviewing -It’s Japan so yes, Japanese is the language used but there is ample opportunity for spoken English or at least subtitles during all shows. -Not enough characters sighted in park. Only saw about 5/6 of the Sesame St characters in the Hollywood area (I think) and that’s it! For the whole 8 hours we were there. -Unlike Disneyland, staff do not give Universal Studio stickers out. You have to request them. Almost all have them so it’s crappy you have to ask. It’s also crappy that there are only a small selection. Disneyland nails this! and it helps keep the kids in queues a bit happier when they hand them out. -Retail merch here was noticeably more expensive than Disney Tokyo a year prior. I expect high prices but I drew the line here as I felt it was a joke. - a number of rides were closed for maintenance and then more due to the rain. - many things closed around 5 pm, too many! With the rain and this, I found the park quite boring and looked forward to leaving but decided to swing by Muppet land where we managed to get on 3 rides in one hour. This area is great for under 5s but in saying that our almost 7 enjoyed it too.  In summary: visited La Universal 10yrs ahi and that was great. This time, with kids, it was a good but a number of disappointments for what it cost (time & $) ,too many things closed, not as exciting or magical as Disney.",Universal Studios Japan
alfaro jimenez,5.0," March 3, 2020",thank god we were able to go here before they closed down,thank god we were able to go here before they closed down great timing. lines were not that long due to the corona virus. harry potter ride wasnt long .we were able to see the attack on titans. love the ride of the flying dinosaur even if the ride waiting time was 3 hours .,Universal Studios Japan
Alice,4.0," February 29, 2020",Great tour,"If you love theme park, we highly recommend to visit Universal Studios. The crowd is not as important as in Disneyland in Tokyo if even if it was during a weekend in the summer. The park is quite big so one whole day is the minimum, and Harry Potter should be the first attraction to be visited since it is quickly full. People are very helpful and the visitors are very polite (queues are always respected), which makes your day way more enjoyable.  Thé only big problem we went through was when we booked through Tripadvisor that cancelled a few days before our weekend our tickets without explanations, we had to buy in a hurry a few days prior to our weekend.",Universal Studios Japan
Katrinus,5.0," February 28, 2020",Surely this is the happiest place on earth!,"We got the day and a half pass and only just got to see all we wanted during this crowd free virus affected period. I can’t ride because of injuries and can be pretty grumpy but the cheerfulness here is catching! I was waving to everyone before I even knew what I was doing and chatted to lots of lovely people in the well behaved queues. My family had an amazing time at this spotlessly clean, crazy organised fun park! Harry Potter fans will especially love the Wizarding World, the night illuminations this month were breathtaking. So glad I included this to balance out all the temple time I put my family through 😉",Universal Studios Japan
Belle S,5.0," February 28, 2020",Just Like A Dream,My experience in this park is better than the original Universal Studios in Hollywood. The waiting lines are not crazy and the rides are so worth it. My favorite is Wizarding World of Harry Potter. It's like you literally stepped into the movie!,Universal Studios Japan
Vhalerie Lee,5.0," February 27, 2020",Wizarding World of Harry Potter,"Make sure to get an express pass ticket because there are long lines at Wizarding World of Harry Potter, and sometimes they only allow a certain group of people to come in here during peak hours even if you already have a ticket. The rides are also quite long so the express pass comes in handy",Universal Studios Japan
flora1602,5.0," February 21, 2020",SO MUCH FUN!!!,Went there on Monday. Booked tickets from the Klook app and got the special entry. Managed to go in 15 mins early than the others. my first ride was the Harry Potter ride! took a lot of pictures with less crowds in it. love the butter beer (Non alcoholic drink) will definitely go here again in the future!,Universal Studios Japan
