Bian,5.0,"May 18, 2021",Universal Studios Singapore,"Universal Studios Singapore opened in 2010. It is part of the Resorts World Sentosa complex on Sentosa Island. I love that each themed zone has its own attractions, shopping, eating establishments and street entertainment. There were rides, street performances, live shows and movie characters. Some of these are available in other theme parks. My favorite is the Water World which showed incredible performances, it has stunt stars in action and a sound stage with special effects where you can experience a hurricane in New York. As well as the Shrek 4-D Adventure. This place is a great attraction to visit for family and friends. One day tour is not enough to experience all the fantastic rides inside Universal Studios Singapore. I rate this destination with 5 stars because I really enjoyed our tour and it never failed to amaze me.",Universal Studios Singapore

MuhdMikhail,4.0,"April 25, 2021","Great experience,bad incident with guest operations","Hi,I just want to say that i did enjot my time at Universal studious Singapore.I managed to take all the rides and had a very memorable day there with the rides. The food was great,atmosphere was good and all the rides had reasonable queue times. I just have one bad experience,mainly at the Far far away.Just as i alighted the Puss-in-Boots ride,and was heading out,i was walking out and a lot of people were walking out too.So I accidentally walked a bit out of line and wanted to walk out.Yes it’s my fault for that,however,one of the worker procceeded to stretch his arm out to my stomach and push me back to line. A simple warning or just telling me to get back would have been okay,but i feel like having contact like that,is not tolerable honestly.Luckily i kept my cool and just walked off,but i feel like the workers should be more patient and carry out their guest operations more calmly,not with physical contact.Yes,it was my fault rhat i walked out of line,but it was really minimal and didn’y deserve to get an arm to my stomach.I too noticed a worker at the Farfaraway dragon ride that shouted at another person because she was taking her time to walk up the stairs after the ride. Guest management should be better at the Farfaraway,and i hope this would go a long way. All the other attractions had excellent to good guest operations,and i really commend it. Would come again!",Universal Studios Singapore
Harald F,2.0,"April 12, 2021",Not worth it,"Many attractions closed, but still full price. No information about this when booking.  I dont think the estimated waiting time functions for the different attractions are correct. Because of covid, every second row of seats on rides are left unused. This doubles the waiting time estimated. Ended up waiting 1 hour + for rides lasting maybe a few minutes.",Universal Studios Singapore
Sam,1.0,"April 9, 2021",No,"On a non-holiday Friday, rides start @ 2pm and each ride has an estimated waiting time of 90mins, which means you are gonna spend 3 hours on the line for every 2 minutes worth of rides.  Food is terrible and overpriced, and it rained when I visited so most rides were closed. Pretty sure I will never ever visit again in my lifetime.",Universal Studios Singapore
Arnav G,5.0,"April 5, 2021",probably the best thing to do in Sg....,"It was a nice day spent in Universal Studios. none of the ride were broken and the shows were amazing. i understand that the queues are humongous, but it worth waiting. the ticket is not that expensive and the stores inside are up the mark too. i recommend the transformers ride, and the 2 main roller coasters (do them again if you get to!)  Best thing to do in singapore.",Universal Studios Singapore

Ebin I,1.0,"March 19, 2021","Terrible. Didn't enjoy the day at all. Long queue, cancelled shows, broke down rides",Terrible. Did not enjoy a single moment.  Don't know why they say there is crowd control. Every ride has more queue than pre covid. Multiple rides broke down multiple times after queuing for hours. All shows are cancelled. All food items also need to queue hours. Hated the day. I thought on a weekday during covid with crowd control it is not bad like this. But boy I was wrong.,Universal Studios Singapore
Pilot Lover,5.0,"March 15, 2021",Great hangout place,"Walking around sentosa is very interesting and fun. los of game parks, restaurants, beach to chill n unwind. Going in daytime can be rather humid. But as sun down hits, the scene is just brilliant.",Universal Studios Singapore
Emmaxxo,5.0,"March 12, 2021",Loved it,Definitely would recommend to anyone any age. Many gaming facilities don’t need to wait in line for a long time.

James Jeremiah Soh,4.0,"February 28, 2021",Universal Studios Singapore Trip,"Glad I bought the S.E.A Aquarium package and Universal Studios Singapore which came with many discounts and vouchers (meal & retail).  Sadly I bought the tickets with hopes of going during the off-peak period of the weekdays as well as during my Stay-cation with the Fiancee, but Universal Studios Singapore is closed from Monday to Wednesday for cleaning due to Covid-19 precautions - so boys trip it was with the buddy as the Fiancee had to go back to work when the attraction is open.  Went in at 3:00 pm, which surprisingly wasn't too crowded on a Friday afternoon - longest waiting time was 30 minutes for Rapids Adventure™, but all in all, it was worth it. With some rides or attractions closed, it definitely means that you will be able to take most of the rides available at least once.  6:00 pm to 8:00 pm is the best time to walk around the attraction to snap photos while reminiscing travelling, so make use of the beautiful sunset and snap away!",Universal Studios Singapore
Bepus,3.0,"February 28, 2021",Nothing much for family with kids,"umm...... Totally understand a lot of limitation during this period. However, really not recommend for the family with kids who is below 3 years old. There is nothing much the child can take.",Universal Studios Singapore

Babeshark,5.0,"February 19, 2021",Game Town Universal Studios,"Singapore is known as a famous tourist city in ASEAN. There are many interesting things here that we should not miss.

Singapore City is also famous for many extremely attractive and varied dishes. Here, you can find all the specialties of Singapore, and you will not be disappointed in their taste. There are many night markets – food parlors. You should prepare a stomach and wallet to enjoy. The faction outside the city is also very beautiful with many tree and high-rise buildings .

Luna,5.0,"February 13, 2021",A Very Different Experience,"I visited on 12/2/2021, first day of the Chinese New Year with my friends. As a local, I've been to the park more than I can remember, including the 6 years of Horror Nights I have went, with season passes and frequent fear passes. It is safe to say I know the park at the back of my hands. I love this place, simply because it is the only theme park in Singapore. I've been to USS for the second time since the pandemic started, once was in November 2020. Yes, coming on a public holiday, I expected crowds and the weather to be bad, totally understandable. Average waiting time for each ride around 5pm was 1-2 hours, okay sure, I can handle that, I've been in line for 3 hours for a haunted house before. I came with a group of friends that were new to theme parks and rides in general, so I really wanted to complete most of the major attractions with them. What bugged me was how slack the social distancing was in some attractions. The Transformers and the Rapids ride had staff telling guests to remain in the boxes while queuing. While I was in the Mummy ride queuing, there was no social distancing enforced and everyone was just cramped together in the tight space. Not to mention, it was around 2pm and they had a technical fault, so we ended up getting on the ride only around 3.30pm, when asked the staff roughly how long it would take, they responded with a simple ""i don't know."" Me and my group were trying to remain in the boxes and maintain that distance with everyone else cramped in the indoor setting, but it was just impossible. Not to mention, as there was no staff there, many had their face masks down, which really bugged my group as we felt really exposed. We were told the rides open at 2 and had early entry to the park. We went at around 12.30, searched for lunch and while eating, we saw that the rides have already operated at around 1.30pm, which caused abit of a rush and confusion for my group as we wanted to be first in line for BSG, but when we got there, it was already crowded. We went to Canopy flyer, which had a technical difficulty, we heard from some passing people that Transformers was down too, so if the rides had issues, shouldn't the park have made sure everything was good before opening the ride instead of rushing to open them? Just my 2 cents.The app for the wait times is a good idea but it doesn't update very frequently, so we have to run back and forth just to make sure that we have enough time to complete at least 3/4 of the rides. (Which we did, completed 10 thank goodness) But we did not stop to eat anything for the rest of the day till 9 pm to complete them. So for people coming on public holidays, please have a hearty meal before coming in as you might not have time to stop for food. We had corndog vouchers that came with the tickets, but the line for it was so long, probably about 50 over in the queue, so we gave it up. We do understand crowds are something that cannot be controlled, plus even with the regulations, the limit for the park is still quite a lot. We just hope that more safe distancing can be enforced on such days as these are the days where more people will be exposed to the virus and people. When I came in November, almost every ride queue had someone to enforce the distancing. I was quite disappointed yesterday, but I am still giving 5 stars because of my love for the park and the wonderful staff that still served with a smile on their face on a busy day. I will be back soon and hopefully, the social distancing system will be much more efficient and better.",Universal Studios Singapore

scotchy_tape,4.0,"January 5, 2021",Enjoyable Day with the Fam at USS,"Weather was a bummer.. but we still had an enjoyable time!  Love the complimentary mask, and we did a lot of Christmas shopping in the shops.. Queue for the ride are long as expected and I think there was something wrong with the Transformer ride as we waited 30mins and it was announced that we had to wait another 30mins. We came out from the queue and the kids took the rollercoasters instead. The queue was much lesser. Eventually, they tried their luck again later in the afternoon and managed to take the ride. The kids were contented.  Sadly, quite a few stations are closed due to covid, but the performance (esp the evening) never failed to bring out the festive mood and that 'inner child' in us.  We really hope this covid will be over soon, and we will be able to bring back the joy and life of USS like it was before!",Universal Studios Singapore
Lim Boon hee,1.0,"January 2, 2021",Don't go during monsoon season,"Not enough shelters from rain. Even shelters have leaks. Wait times are horrendous for all rides. Puddles and pools of water in queue areas. Nothing really happening whole day except for a few characters and two singing on stage. They should compensate for lack of floats, parades and fireworks with more characters but unfortunately - just a couple of bored characters only. Waste of time and money in the rain.",Universal Studios Singapore
Irishluck,1.0,"December 30, 2020",Bad experience in Dec,"My 2 daughters (7 and 4) and I visited on 28th Dec. We had a terrible experience on many levels. We are repeat annual pass holders.  Let me start by saying we knew that there was a risk of crowds during the school holidays. Also, we know that we are in a unique situation with Covid and many businesses are struggling with the measures needed to keep safe.  However, it seems USS are really putting guest experience low down on the list of priorities. Guest safety has to come of course but at what cost?  The trouble for us started even before we got to in to the park. We arrived at 2pm and the entry queue was all the way passed Candylicious i.e. at least 500m away. I approached a USS staff at the queue and asked if there was still a priority line for annual pass holders. She told me ""no, please join the line."" So I had to walk all the way to the back of the line. After 1 minute of queuing another staff noticed our lanyards and said if we're annual pass holders then go to the front and use the priority queue.  Once in the park, the theme of queuing was everywhere. My 7 year old decided to queue for Enchanted Airways so she went in alone and I was watching her from the front of the building. The queue moved and she went out of sight around the side of the building and I followed. I didn't notice at first but the queue went around the side of the building, down the back, and returned to the main entrance. What was appalling was that most of the queue was left exposed to the sun.  This is unforgiveable. It showed me right there that USS are more concerned about $$$ than people.  I pulled my daughter out of the queue as she said ""Daddy, this is too much"".  Every single other ride we stopped at (including the Madagascar merry go round) looked like the wait was at least 45 - 60 mins. The more popular rides I would say you'd need to queue for at least 90 mins - 2 hours. This is just nuts.  We spent the rest of the afternoon just going around the shops and people watching. One thing that USS did do well was putting on more frequent character shows which was enjoyable.  Then we tried to get into Mel's Drive In for dinner. Guess what, we had to queue to get in, had to queue to order and then wait for the food prep.  All in all this was a terrible experience for us. Again I want to say that this is no fault of the staff in the park. This issue is firmly with senior management and their interpretation of what is acceptable sacrifice under the current management measures. It looks like they've decided that guest experience is the first to go.  I am a senior operations leader in the real estate industry so I know full well how hard it is to get a balance at the moment. But for USS, the numbers in the park simply need to be controlled better. They've got the balance wrong right now and guests are suffering.  We will not be renewing our annual passes again.",Universal Studios Singapore
mayi,1.0,"December 27, 2020",horrible.,We booked our tickets beforehand but theres still another booking within the ticket we were supposed to do but missed out because we obviously didn't read the ticket after we bought it... and it was not mentioned when we bought the ticket or after payment on the website either :/ after we went the queue stretched from USS to candylicious all around.. they obviously overbooked themselves?? if you guys just had lesser number of people allowed in per day the queues and the overcrowding would be solved. we went all the way there only to be rejected and asked to come back another day. Ive never seen a double booking system because of covid and other attractions like WWW are able to manage crowd amazingly please improve on this and don't just think of the money and end up overbooking yourselves.,Universal Studios Singapore
Anonymous:D,5.0,"December 26, 2020",Good info inside:),"I went with my fam today and I recommend ppl to come earlier if not at later maybe at 6 or 7 because if u come early at least u can get ready to queue first as these days uss rides are open 2-9pm so most ppl don't rlly start queuing before 1.40. In the afternoon 2-3-4 quite a lot of ppl but def worth it there's social distancing crew and make sure every body is in place they are extremely friendly and kind aswell. 1 ride prob needs 30-60mins in the afternoon. (depends on what ride u are going for). If u are wondering if the rides are open during rain? For my experience when I was queuing for the battlestar galactica it started to rain and they didn't close at all. They will only close when there thunderstorms/lightning or very bad heavy rain. But yea they still open it when it's drizzling and raining:) When at night around 7-8 most rides queue are rlly short. For my experience I rided the human and cylon at around 8-9 and there was honestly no queue only for the cylon only a few people in front but at night the view are spectacular! I recommend booking first before coming. Cause going inside without booking queue could be quite LONG. And I mean it. Most food restaurants are close but the ones open queue are long aswell and expensive but the food is very delicious! Don't bring too much stuff or big bags into uss as when yr riding the attractions u HAVE to put yr belongings in the locker and the lockers are quite tiny. The lockers is free for the first 45 mins so when yr going to change your attractions rides u should change to another locker that is close to the ride if you want free lockers. Rides I recommend for teens or adults that's above 125 in height: revenge of the mummy,cylon,human For kids:Puss in boots and other kiddi rides:) Personal for me the cylon and human (Battlestar Galactica) is the BEST! I def recommend you coming here!! It's a good tourism attractions 👍",Universal Studios Singapore

All ride are available apart from ones that are not within the pandemic SOP water water related parks. Ride lines are relatively long but it is still ok.

AKAP,1.0,"December 21, 2020",Super bad experience,"It was supposed to be a place of fun. However, during the covid19. With the cut down of capacity, the park just tried to maximize their profit at the expense of customer experience. So many food and beverage outlets are closed leading to main f&b outlet to be immensely queued up. Normal snack and drink requires around 30mins queue. I suspected they also kept selling express pass without any capacity control. Leading express queue wait approximately 60-90mins for all rides. The experience is utterly ridiculous.",Universal Studios Singapore

Karen Yeo,1.0,"December 20, 2020",Horrible HR staff,"I am having a terrible time with ticket booking issues. On 10 December, I booked a ticket for my 10-year-old son to go to USS on 21 December. I hold an annual pass, so I need to book on a separate calendar. Because I was busy, I could not book my time slot beforehand. I also did not receive the confirmation email with my son's ticket confirmation number until 2.42am on the morning of 21 December. I need that confirmation number to book the time slot. This is my second time booking the ticket online; the first time, all went smoothly. This time, I had to deal with a dismissive staff member, Nur Amirah Huda, who told me that the confirmation email had been successfully sent to me. What use is it if it's sent to me only on the morning of my booking? All the time slots have been taken up! Nur Amirah also told me to check my junk email often, as if I don't do that. So dismissive. I'm now left to deal with it myself. I probably have to forsake the ticket. School is reopening, and I won't have time to go.

Christine,1.0,"December 14, 2020",PUSS IN BOOTS ADVENTURE,"My wife and I are senior citizens.  On 10 December 2020 ,Thursday, we went on a family outing to Universal Studios Theme Park together with our children.  We entered the park at 1 pm and proceeded to have our lunch. After lunch , we decided to visit the ride called “Puss in Boots Adventure”  Our daughter checked the description from the YouTube video and it stated that it is a gentle ride. We queued up and was informed by the duty personnel that there was a slight delay in starting the ride as they needed to “TEST” the ride.  After a half hour wait , about 2 pm we boarded the capsule ( four of us in one capsule ) ‘  The capsule glided upwards slowly. Then the ride downwards began to gain speed after we reached the Higher levels and very soon it suddenly jammed to a stop abruptly ( similar to someone braking very hard as the car was travelling at speed 40 KM/hr.)  The abrupt and sudden stop caused our body to hit very hard against the safety bar in front of us. (Forward momentum and sudden stop )  Before we could recover , the capsule moved forward again at fast speed for 30 seconds before coming to another abrupt and sudden stop . This again caused our body to lunge forward and hit against the safety bar / restraint. Then it moved forward at a fast speed again  After a couple more of such unpleasant and abrupt stops , we reached the end of the ride.  Our complaint is that  1.Such abrupt “stop and start” are intentional and caused by the technician's programme. 2.it was unexpected that this ride would be so violent , jerky and unsafe. We spoke with the staff at the gate when we queued up and she said it is a slow gentle ride downwards. 3.It caused great discomfort to us and others during and after the ride. Please investigate and give us a reply soonest.",Universal Studios Singapore
Lovetravelling275,1.0,"December 12, 2020",Waste of time and money,"I visited the park on 10 December and it was a waste of time! Truly regret booking the tickets as I find that USS is just profiteering from people who use their SingapoRediscovers vouchers.  Given the fact that the park now operates within limited hours - 2 pm to 9 pm only, effort should have been made to control the number of people who are able to book and enter the park on any given day, to provide a conducive environment for all. However, this was not the case and for some rides, the waiting time was 2 hours, after which all other visitors were turned away as the queue was temporarily closed. Most other rides had a waiting time of between 1 hour and 1.5 hours.  I hope that the USS management will look into this matter and strive to be more sincere in their offerings to the public. Although most people would be using the SingapoRediscovers vouchers, at the end of the day, it is still money and it could have been better spent elsewhere.",Universal Studios Singapore
Wenglairene,2.0,"December 12, 2020",Did not have fun,"Really disappointing experience. I have visit USS many times and this is the only one time that we couldn't wait to leave the place. Firstly, although early entry is at 12 noon, rides only start at 2 p.m. Some were opened a bit earlier. During normal time, the 2 hours could be just nice for us to grab a bite, do some shopping or walk around to catch some meet and greet. But unfortunately, there was very limited food outlets opened, so each food outlet has long queues. And the meet and greet sessions were few and far in between. So it was a really boring 2 hours.  Once the rides started at 2p.m., the queues are super long. This is due to some shows and rides are not opened plus the fact that most restaurants and food outlets were closed, yet there is a good crowd. Hence the visitors would have nothing to do but to take the rides. Each ride queue is really 1 hour or more. So be prepared to maybe have maximum 5 rides during your visit. Worst still is when it rains, as the restaurants were closed, there is little place for shelter.  The place also looks very much in need of a good uplift, paint work is getting faded and dated and looks unattractive. Also please do thorough checks for technical glitches before the rides open and not during ""showtime"". Imagine queueing for more than half hour and then hearing announcement that there are technical glitches and the time for rectification is indeterminate. Very disappointing.",Universal Studios Singapore
Jay,1.0,"December 11, 2020",One of my worst experience in an attraction,"I would like to complaint about the experience I had at Universal Studio Singapore. There was some unforeseen circumstances that had stop the ride ""Human"" 3 times and we had to queue for so long. After leaving the queue, almost most of the rides were closed as well. How are people suppose to enjoy the trip to USS with almost 40% of the rides closed. People spent so much money just to visit. Other than that, what's the point of having time slots when there are still so many people in the park. It is honestly more than the amount of people I went when there was no pandemic. The workers did not even bother to check the time slots whether it's 2pm or the other time slot. There was crowds everywhere, crowding in areas, so many restrictions were broken. I only manage to ride 1 ride after 3 hours, two of the rides I've been to closed down mid way, the rest were fully crowded with people as the main attractions were close. It was definitely a disappointing experience for me and it was saddening. hopefully you guys can do something about it.",Universal Studios Singapore

The rides are very wimpy by world standards and even the two main roller coasters are far below modern standards. The Transformers and Mummy rides are probably two of the best attractions. The Jurassic Park water ride is fun but quite lame in its intensity: it's almost like they went out of their way to avoid you getting wet with things squirting OVER YOU rather than onto you. Some of the ride elements on Jurassic Park also needed obvious upkept. The rest of the rides are mostly for children and low thrill adults. The Canopy ride is super short (like 30 seconds) and offers only small children a thrill. There's another small coaster by the castle (forget its name) that looks like it's for children but is actually kind of cool for its size. Elmo's Spaghetti Ride is one of the parks nicest imaginative surprises and is easy to overlook: a must for children of all ages.  Universal Studios Singapore may be one of the best things to do in Singapore but as for theme parks, it's on the lower end by world standards.",Universal Studios Singapore

Eatsleeprepeat86,2.0,"November 10, 2020",Long waiting times,"I love to go to theme parks, but universal studios singapore need to work on a lot of things. It has crazy long waiting times for the rides. Nothing mentioned about rides and shows who where closed during this period. Food and drinks hard to find and really expensivecrazy. We went there during halloween season (covid). We expected lots of halloween decoration, but it was hard to find (almost nothing). And if they promote halloween outside the park and on their website you will expect amazing decorations. Like other theme parks do even during this period. There where some selected timings for meeting the universal characters that was fun to see.We went from 3 pm to 7.30 pm and only managed to ride 3 rides. Waiste of time and money (overprized) Will think about twice if i will go again.",Universal Studios Singapore
Lynn C,3.0,"November 10, 2020",Long lines and the rides broke down,I visited universal studios and was surprised by the 1 1/2 hour wait at the mummy ride when they only said it would be 45 min. It didn’t seem very crowded but the wait was especially long and then the transformers ride broke down! And they only gave us one fast pass to take another ride! It was overpriced and not as fun as I expected.,Universal Studios Singapore

CMSHS,1.0,"September 27, 2020",Disappointing,"When it takes over an hour and half just to enter the place you know things arent going to be great, Once into the park things didnt get any better. The wait times for rides were out of control. After another 3 hours and only two rides we decided to cut our looses and leave (best decision of that excursion). Surely Universal has a responsibility to ensure that patrons get what they paid for rather than filling the park to capacity and subjecting them to endless wait times. We wont be back!",Universal Studios Singapore

John Jackson,5.0,"September 9, 2020",One of the top 10 places to visit in Singapore and a good day to spend!,I prefer that place during the Halloween month since It will be open at night!

Human Being,4.0,"September 6, 2020","Great, but outdated","I love Universal Singapore, I have a season pass and go there whenever I have the time.  2 years ago, they announced 2 new lands coming and I was very excited, but I emailed USS multiple times and they say they don't know. This is the only universal park around the world that hasn't changed much since opening. I love Universal, but sometimes you have to switch things up to keep people interested. I think attendance would increase greatly if new things were added. Cmon Universal, add new attractions! keep people excited!  P.S: Please resume the shows, the USA parks have resumed them already but for some reason USS hasn't",Universal Studios Singapore
Holly,2.0,"September 5, 2020",The Worst Theme Park,"Well a lot of the restaurants are closed inside the park due to the Covid-19, making it really inefficient. The food is just horrid and extremely overpriced, so make sure to leave the park to eat food. In general, this park is far more suitable for children. When it comes to teens/adults, there aren't many rides that give you adrenaline except Cyclon and Human. The park is not very refurbished, and the architecture isn't as beautiful as other Universal Studios/ theme parks in general. Theme parks are supposed to have themes, obviously, and the Singapore Universal studios has really tacky themes that are basiscally just paint.  The only attraction I would reccomend is the Water works performance, as it is quite entertaining. Everything else is for children, and not the best.",Universal Studios Singapore
Veron C,5.0,"September 4, 2020",Fun = Universal Studio Singapore (USS),"In any Universal Studio, fun and thrills are the key expectation. The rides; rollercoaster for blood rising, mummy ride not for the faint hearted. Otherwise there is the kiddy carousel and 4D theater ride. The merchandise of each focus area dotted the fun park. The main street has the most stores. The food carts, restaurant and toilets are plentiful. Good fun to spend a day at USS in Sentosa island.",Universal Studios Singapore
Lesley E,3.0,"September 4, 2020",Largest Universal studios outside of the USA,"Spent a lovely day exploring the park, kids enjoyed themselves on the rides, food was quite expensive but I guess that is always to be expected.

Unfortunately, the retail outlet was closed. Did a check on the website prior to my visit but nothing was mentioned of the closure.  I approached Yong Xun at Universal Studio Store for assistance to check if other outlets are holding merchandise from Carter’s C. I was expecting a negative response but Yong Xun made my day, as he made the effort to clarify the gift I was looking for and attempted to check its availability with other outlets. It turned out That’s A Wrap was the only outlet carrying the product.

Jingpei,5.0,"August 14, 2020",Reduced crowd and more enjoyable visit,"Back again after a few months because I bought the half season pass. Playing pretend to be tourist in own country on a weekday has its perks as crowd is much thinner, mostly due to COVID-19. Interestingly, where we didnt see a lot of people, the rides are chock full of them as the waiting time stretches up to 1.5 hrs to 2 hrs, notably due to social distancing and limited number of people can get on the rides due to enforcement of distancing. It is a good thing actually. Kudos to the staff for diligently wiping down every seat and cabin whenever each ride is completed. Timed tickets have to be issued for certain rides as they are overwhelmingly popular. Good idea though as it spaced out the crowd but at the same time created additional long queues to get the tickets.",Universal Studios Singapore

Angelo G,5.0,"August 3, 2020",Fun and eventful day,"So all in all Universal Studios is a really nice place to spend the day and when I say day o mean the entire day. Be prepared as there is a lot of walking involved and worst of all is that you WILL end up standing in the lines for a long long time. Depending on when you go, you may only have a chance to go on the rides only once. The worst part is waiting in the lines for the rides however, if you have a fast track pass then you will possibly end up spending less time in the lines but you will no less need to wait as there are a number of people who purchase the express passes.  Other than this, the rides are enjoyable and fun. From the Transformers ride to the Mummy's revenge and Jurassic Park (you will get wet in this ride), these are fun filled and exciting. The Cyclone rollercoaster is a very fast fun filled adrenalin rushed ride and totally worth it (if you are not afraid of being twisted and spun upside down).  Food is overpriced as expected and sadly the pizza were not up to standard and £ ended up wasting over $30.00 there.",Universal Studios Singapore

Spicy,1.0,"July 27, 2020",AVOID UNTIL PARK IS COVID 19 RESTRICTIONS HAVE BEEN REMOVED AND SOCIAL DISTANCING STAFF HAVE PROPER TRAINING,"Very disappointing visit during the recent Singapore school holiday in July.  After arriving at 1200pm (to enjoy early entry) I was surprised to learn that rides did not start operating until 130pm. Which was not advised in advance.  Entry to park was relatively easy, however, overall experience was very much reduced by the very RUDE, AGGRESSIVE, AND DISRESPECTFUL 'so called' SAFE DISTANCING AMBASSADORS deployed throughout the park, in numbers it seemed more than the park employers. These folks truly made the experience truly forgettable... -yelling at families walking too closely together -harassing families of 3 and 4 lining up for rides, informing them that even families of 3 and 4 cannot line up together for rides due to alledged government regulations (which is incorrect as the government rule is now groups of 5). -just generally being RUDE and lacking any customer service training: for example ""Sir, please stand being the line... SIR, YOU ARE STANDING ON THE LINE""  Generally regular employees were pleasant, however, reduced capacity on rides made posted waiting times to be very inaccurate.  Rides were operating at slower than normal intervals, which, along with reduced capacity on each ride led to very long waiting times given park admission was supposed to be limited to 25%.  A number of attractions were closed.  Overall disappointing experience given there was no discount on ticketing.  Recommendation: AVOID UNTIL PARK HAS PROPERLY REOPENED and SOCIAL DISTANCING AMBASSADORS RECEIVE PROPER CUSTOMER SERVICE TRAINING.",Universal Studios Singapore
Alex M,1.0,"July 23, 2020",WORST USS experience I ever had,"Because some our friends went the very first day of the re-opening and they had a great experience, we thought that we could have the same, even by going on a weekend (the next Saturday after re-opening) . That was a very bad decision.  So yes of course, the park had to be very careful with safety and hygiene, but then don't open the park with so many people, and with unlimited fast pass...  We paid 59 SGD, and got into 4 attractions in total in the 4 hours we spent there. And hold on, the attractions were: - 2 times Transformers, - 1 time one of the Galactica (for which we waited 1h30 in the queue) - 1 time a very lame attraction next to the Galactica, because there was no-one queuing.  At some point, we had some hope to go in the Mummy because we were given a pass for a later timing, but once there on the expected time, the announced queue was more than 1 hour. WTF!  Please review your number of admissions in the park, or try to be more efficient on the cleaning, and do not allow the unlimited fast pass. We saw so many guys doing 3 to 4 times the Galactica for instance while we were still in the queue.  Thanks in advance for the next visitors",Universal Studios Singapore

Safe distancing ambassadors are around to enforce the rules. Machines are cleaned after every ride. Had Vegetarian Noodles at Discovery food court and I loved it :) . To complete most of the attractions it took me around 7 hours.  Notes:  For this covid phase pass holders please make reservations prior to visit the attraction place.

mark_from_singapore,3.0,"July 18, 2020",Limited,"I've been many times to USS and it's just so-so. You're getting a park with a few great rides but it is only a small place so for any age group there's likely to be less than 5 attractions that really hit a sweet spot. Its a theme park and it's in Singapore so of course it's not cheap and I'd say it's generally worth the express pass if you don't want to devote a full day and 40+ mins queueing per ride. Human, Cylon, Mummy and Transformers are the proper thrill rides and all good fun. The F&B options are terrible and USS should be ashamed that they don't offer any healthier choices than highly processed food and drinks packed with additives, sugar and salt. It's 2020 and I think they are misreading their customers... I think a lot of people now want healthier, lighter options. Get a Salad Stop franchise in there, an Acai Affair and a Sushi Tei, to provide a bit more variety. The worst thing about the park is the pipes music which is inescapable everywhere and seems to be the same 10 song playlist blasting out. Have a few quieter zones where parents can take a sensory break for half an hour, please!",Universal Studios Singapore

Obviously the park issues tickets only 25% of usual capacity due to Covid-19, though the park was busy as always and with safety measure in place and lot's of cleaning in-between the rides, the waiting time was outrages. My kids arrived at 2pm and left at 7pm highly disappointed. We had to pay full price (85 SGD) and my complaint to the management wasn't heard off. I strongly recommend to avoid the park - at least during Covid-19 restrictions on the rides (not on the people as they have to make to money and allow full crowed to come in).",Universal Studios Singapore

There are two kinds of fireworks show, one is in Jurassic park and the other one is a normal fireworks show in midnight. Many tourists love to come to this place, without visiting this attraction they haven't completely or half visited Singapore. There are many easy and comfortable ways to reach this attraction. There are also many shops in here. They are always at the end of the rides. You can even see your photos in some of the rides. I recommend every traveler to visit this place.

Reeti Banerjee,5.0,"April 26, 2020",The Best Destination for a Fun-filled Day!,"On my recent visit to Singapore, I headed to this amusement park. I was a little upset as the Harry Potter world is not present here. However, my sad feelings disappeared once I entered the venue. Amid the Covid-19 outbreak, the staff was maintaining absolute cleanliness and every ride was being sanitized persistently. Even the washrooms were cleaned frequently. The rides were so good! For the first timers: You should start your journey from Madagascar zone and end your day with New York zone as the intensity of rides this way, goes on from Level 1-10. If you want to start with the most thrilling rides, then do just the opposite of the previously said option. The park also consists of various vendors selling ice-cream, soda, Coke, and other refreshments in every zone. Also, each zone includes restaurants. I ate at Oasis Spice Café located in Ancient Egypt zone. It has a wide range of vegetarian and non-vegetarian food items. You can always share and eat if you are in a group. Also, almost every ride has sinks inside to fill your empty water bottles, which is really helpful during sunny days. Overall, had an amazing time!",Universal Studios Singapore
HeatSeekerWrexham_UK,5.0,"April 23, 2020","Great rides, great staff, but a few poor features","We had season passes and visited many times between January and March. When we first arrived the park was extremely busy, and then we saw it very quiet when the coronavirus cleared Singapore of most visitors. Although the park is small, it never feels crowded. But at first we did find queue times excessive, worse than on previous visits to Singapore. Rides are well maintained and compared to the UK breakdowns are infrequent. There is a good choice of rides, from exciting roller coasters to gentle well themed rides. In addition the park is well themed, so do spend some time just enjoying this; don’t miss the walkway around the lake, you get some great views from there. Food in the park is good, but expensive. However do think how much you’ve paid to be in the park, I feel it’s better to accept the higher prices and enjoy the experience in the well themed restaurants, rather than save money by leaving the park. There’s an app which is a fairly easy way to get park opening hours but watch out, it doesn’t open to the day of your visit, it always opens to the first of the month, sometimes the previous month. Queue times are erratic, and often incorrect, but it gives you some idea of how busy the park is. Even when the park was busy, there was quite a gap between shows at Shrek and Lights Camera Action. They won’t give a countdown timer for the next show, nor tell you when the show starts, so assume you’ll have to wait for the full waiting time displayed at the show entrance. Only Waterworld has shows at set times which is clearly displayed. There’s a fountain area near the food court in Jurassic Park, it’s been broken for over a year. I’m disabled and I find the staff gave us an exceptional amount of help. Because we spent quite a few days in the park we were recognised and warmly welcomed when we arrived, and staff made sure we had an easy entrance to the park. They also ensured we had a really good time going on the rides. By contrast, the design of the park is poor for the disabled. Full marks to Enchanted Airways for providing a special staircase for the disable, nice wide gentle steps, and even a stairlift. But why oh why didn’t they give the staircase a handrail? The disabled could enjoy all the shows, but the design really spoils the shows for the disabled. Shrek 4D, we had to enter the theatre early, and missed part of the pre-show. That was our only complaint, although we always have to sit rather to one side. Waterworld, the disabled sit at the very back. In addition I couldn’t see the most spectacular stunt, because a block of speakers blocked my view. I used to really enjoy the show when I could sit near the front, I won’t bother to watch it again, I was so far from the action. Lights Camera Action, after baking in the queue area I was required to stay at the very end of the row, and couldn’t see most of the show. Really disappointing, I won’t be going again. If you live in Singapore, I’m sure you’ll have a great time there while visitor numbers are low. Let’s hope tourism starts again, I’m looking forward to enjoying the rides, great shame about the shows.",Universal Studios Singapore

Amit_Ambar,5.0,"April 12, 2020",A fun day at universal,"Universal Studio is a must visit if you go to Singapore. The park is divided into different sections according to the movies and each section has some amazing rides. Since we had quite a lot of time, we did most of the rides if not all. We went at around 1pm in the evening and stayed till 10:30 when it closes and honestly you can do more rides in the last 2-3 hours than in the whole day as the rides have very long queues during the day. There are rides for all ages. There are multiple shows which take place in a day. Since we went around Christmas time, we got to see the Christmas Spectacular Fireworks which were also good.",Universal Studios Singapore
Mohit Bagda,5.0,"April 12, 2020",Great is the word,"Hello guys  Once again this is mohit , hope you all are under lockdown state , I travelled Singapore a month back from 5th March to 11th March 2020 . We were also very scared to go but atlast we made it . It was a very fruitful trip to Singapore for us as due to covid 19 many of the travellers cancelled their trips and due to that there was no crowd or ques anywhere in any of the tourist spot . We reached universal studio at 12 pm in afternoon and we finished well on time at 5 pm which is a closing time for the park . It’s full of fun for all age group from 2 years Kids till aged people . I was accompanied by my wife 2 years daughter and my senior citizens mother father . The main attractions are both the roller coasters and the dark room roller coaster means 3 rides and the transformer ride , if you do these 4 rides your ticket value you have used it as these 4 rides are very new and uncommon in other parks anywhere else . For the food veg options are very less , you can take your own in bags , rest options are also very expensive . Some pics I have attached for the reference but if you have gone in a peak season the ques are huge so be at time at 9 am sharp When gates are open, as sharp 5 PM they close all rides and no entry is allowed . Take care love you readers and be safe at home.  Mohit jain Mumbai , India",Universal Studios Singapore
Nikhil,5.0,"April 10, 2020",Universal studios Singapore,Visiting universal studios was a great experience for me. The rides were really fun and I loved the food there :) The only down side was that there were many people and the que to the transformer ride was 2 hours.But it was a great place I had lots of fun and I recommend it to you,Universal Studios Singapore

Watsson,5.0,"March 27, 2020",Great day in the park,"The park is small and if you get there early - it opens at 10 - and if it’s not too crowded, you can do it all by closing - 17:00. My favorites - the roller coaster where your feet hang down and the one in the ancient Egypt area. Small kids love the Sesame Street characters. Megaton (a Transformer) is a hoot. And be sure to get popcorn from the street vendor near the entrance.",Universal Studios Singapore

However if you are with friends you better visit transformer and go anti clockwise around the park",Universal Studios Singapore
Neris29,5.0,"March 21, 2020",Good fun,Went to Universal Studios in the middle of the Covid 19 pandemic and was very impressed to see the staff and management taking extra effort to keep visitors safe. This included painstakingly marking out the queueing areas with boxes to ensure social distancing and wiping down the rides with sanitizer after every round of rides. Do visit the park when it opens at 10am as queues are shortest at that time. Also download the Universal Studios Singapore app as it will help indicate the updated waiting times so that you can maximise your time in the park instead of waiting unnecessarily. Battlestar Galactica and Canopy Flyer always seem to have long waiting times so you should try to target those first.,Universal Studios Singapore

Erika Narciza,4.0,"March 12, 2020",Try the Mummy Ride,"My friends and I recently visited USS despite the COVID-19 scare (we're fearless that way. Haha!) The experience is totally different from my previous trips to this amusement park because there are no queue at all. The thrill rides are awesome as always. The Mummy is still my favorite, followed by the Transformers and then The Jurassic Park Rapids. The staff are friendly and helpful especially when someone is having trouble with the lockers. Local food is better outside though. But all in all, a day in USS is still a fun (and tiring) day. Be sure to wear comfy shoes. :)",Universal Studios Singapore
geminigemini,5.0,"March 10, 2020",Great fun for whole family!,I’ve been in Universal Studios in the US and this is more a small theme park with some great rides. Very clean throughout with friendly staff. Because of the corona virus scare the park was very empty with only about a five minute wait for any ride which was perfect as we had three young children with us! Easily walkable for any age. My family had annual passes and it was $38 for my day pass. If you go with someone who has a pass you get a reduction from regular fare. Prices for food and gifts in the various places were what you would expect in a theme park. The Mummy ride had technical issues while we were on it meaning we had to get off it! My seven year old granddaughter was being brave and trying it for the first time with her Mom and I and was freaking out a bit at the mummy room when it stopped! Now her Mom and I were temporarily freaking out a bit lol. Since they needed to turn on the lights to get us off the ride she saw the special effects which made it possible to get her back on it when it was fixed. She absolutely loved the ride and can’t wait to go back again! It’s a great ride! All the rides were fun and we had a great time there. It’s a fair bit out of the city and it seems the best way to get there is a grab or a taxi.,Universal Studios Singapore

We were there on a Tuesday and staff were saying how quiet it was (coronavirus numbers down) but quing times for major rides was still 40 minutes so on busy days who knows. Minor rides 10 minutes.

The trip allowed us to be kids on a grown ups budget which was awesome Cos we could have all the candy and rides that we wanted...  Our entry tickets were included with our hotel booking which also made it feel like we were getting a bargain which appealed to the adults in us.  We made our way to universal studios with high enthusiasm and loved every single minute.. even waiting in lines for rides... we enjoyed meeting the characters and posing with the figurines around..  Everything was well organised in that we never felt too crowded or too alone in any area of the busy park. Traffic kept moving well, the operators were friendly and structured and ran a good busy operation.  We went on all the major attractions and water world tour.  Highly recommend for all ages to allow your childlike enthusiasm to shine again.  (Trip was in 2013- TripAdvisor doesn’t allow me to enter that date)",Universal Studios Singapore

Lisa_LTN,3.0,"February 24, 2020",Not as good as expected,"Having visited Universal in Orlando I had quite high expectations which unfortunately this didn't live up to. There aren't that many rides and a couple of the bigger ones were out of action due to ""technical difficulties"".  It wasn't particularly busy which meant we were able to get on the rides which were running relatively quickly but ultimately I don't think what is there is worth the ticket price.  It is probably a good place to take young children but as two adults there wasn't enough to keep us entertained for very long.",Universal Studios Singapore
ukpooky,5.0,"February 24, 2020",Great day out,The park was almost empty when we visited as a lot of tourists have stayed away from big tourist hotspots and gatherings due to coronavirus.  We waited maximum 5 minutes and did every ride in the park between 11-3 in the day! Our favourite was The Mummy ride. There's a good mix of high/low thrill rides for a balanced day.  We got a taxi from downtown (about $10 each way) and just bought tickets at the park. No need at all for express pass as no queues!,Universal Studios Singapore

Despite it being a Saturday the lines weren't as nearly as long as expected The longest waiting time we encountered was only 35 min.

Dan G,3.0,"February 22, 2020",Lots of rides closed at various times in the day,"We had a good fun here but at the start of the day many of the bigger rides were closed for ‘technical faults’ but it felt as though they were closed because the park was quiet, more rides opened up as the day went on and the park got busier. Not a bad theme park.",Universal Studios Singapore
Travelswithboxers,3.0,"February 22, 2020",Dread to think what it's like when it's busy!,"We visited on a Sunday and the park was eerily quiet because of corona virus, meaning we could access all the rides with virtually zero queues. The highlight was the transformers ride, which we did several times, a ""rollercoaster"" without moving, all done via video - excellent for those of us with bad backs and necks. The Shred 4D was great fun, most of the other rides were ok, but if we had had to have queued for 30m+ for each, we would have been very disappointed. At c$80pp we managed to get our value, particularly from transformer ride. We saw an excellent dance crew in the Hollywood zone. We didn't try the main rollercoasters (not physically up to it).  Overall, it's very compact and probably not enough rides to justify the price at very busy times, but having virtually the entire park to ourselves was quite fun.",Universal Studios Singapore
adet,5.0,"February 20, 2020",Brillant,This was great experience althoughwe did not have enough time to go on every ride. You would need two days to do the whole place justice. I must admit it was very quite and so therefore there were next to no queue's.,Universal Studios Singapore

Capelo,5.0,"February 17, 2020",5 tips,"1) buy the express pass. It's well worth it since even for the mediocre rides there can be long waits. 2) get there early - it gets very hot in mid day so get there as early as it opens so you can do 1 or 2 rides before lunch time. 3) if you want the big rides, go there 1st. Dont waste time seeing everything along the way. The park is small, so you will get a chance to see. The big rides get very busy, so go there quickly! Also the express pass doesnt work in some of them. 4) eat at the diner at the entrance of the park. Best food and options compared to the rest or exit the park and eat at one of the many options outside. 5) take water and a mini fan if you got it. It gets hot, and even waiting in line you'll be sweaty.",Universal Studios Singapore
leenuleenu100,4.0,"February 17, 2020",A fun day with kids,Visited the Universal Studios Singapore with two kids (12 and 4). Since the Corona virus panic there is very few people and no ques so we were able to go to all attractions with basically no waiting time. The kids loved every one of the rides and they have different rides for every age. Only one ride (the red rollercoster) was closed due to maintenance work but as it was announced to us in the ticket counter we had no problem with that. We loved that many of the attractions were suitable for our 4-years old he is fearless but if your child is more shy you should consider going few years later. The staff is really friendly and there is pleanty of restrooms and places to buy water etc. Despite some negative comments in internet saying it is dated etc I still would recommend it if you have not been to places like this. Full day of fun for kids and it was such a joy to see them so happy!,Universal Studios Singapore

Nitwit2015,5.0,"February 16, 2020",Couldn’t have been better,"This place was truly amazing and requires a whole day to explore. Sadly they had curtailed the timings from 10:00 am to 5:00 pm so we missed out on a few rides. To ensure the best please check the timings before you go to universal. Weekends the park is open for a longer periods. The parade is another added attraction which takes place occasionally and I believe is mentioned on their site. We went their when the corona virus scare had created a lot of panic so we did not have to wait at all for the rides. The transformers, mummy returns and the roller coaster rides are simply amazing and shouldn’t be missed. There are various shows happening on the premises and the timings are mentioned on pamphlets kept at the entrance. The show for kids that we managed to see were the seasame street show and donkey show which was laughable and for all ages. There are lots of resturants,snacks counter, toilets and water filling stations spread over the premises. It is generally hot round the year so keep yourself well hydrated at all times. Download their free app to make your visit better. It’s so lively and captivating that you hardly know when ur times up!!!!",Universal Studios Singapore

We are in mid 30s, pretty much nothing left, a bit scammed for 324 sgd...

Rob C,3.0,"February 14, 2020",Best time to go,"Pretty much hopped off one ride and straight onto the next. The corona virus has pretty much emptied the theme park so i had a great time and got my moneys worth from the rides. Unfortunately, thats the only upside. The park is a lot smaller than i expected and we completed all the rides in a couple of hours. The park itself is showing its age and reminds of a dated traveling fairground,not a world class theme park. The food offering was really poor, $45 for a couple of burgers and fries which were not freshly cooked. If your lookong for cold drinks or a quock bite to eat, just leave the park and pick up something from the 7/11 right outside the main gate.",Universal Studios Singapore

Ruby,5.0,"February 11, 2020",Amazing! Can’t wait to go back,"I went to Universal Studios with two of my friends, we are all in our late teens/ early 20s. We had a wonderful time. I have previously been to Universal in Hollywood and I found that Singapore Universal had just as much to offer. I highly recommend going during a quieter season as there are little to no lines. I was concerned before arriving that we will waste the day if we didn’t have a fast pass (based on previous experience) but as it was a quite season with no school holidays I am glad we saved the money. My friends and I were able to go on all the rides we wanted, multiple times and meet the different characters. The longest we waited all day was 30 minutes, the shortest was about 5 minutes. I recommend the Mummy ride, the Transformers 4D experience and the two roller coasters that are intertwined.",Universal Studios Singapore

My girls went for the Merry Go-Round Ride. The staff on duty were the most unfriendly humans that I have ever met. He never smiles and gave a killer look at kids if they are too hyper in their seats. I think the staff working in this Studio needs more training on ""serving with a smile"". Souvenirs are more expensive than US. I think they should provide more public seats and shades. It will benefit the elderly when they need to take rest from walking. The rides are quite interesting. My girls enjoyed themselves.",Universal Studios Singapore

SurinderAnand,4.0,"February 5, 2020",Nice Attractions,Not at par with US but experience was satisfactory. Start anti clockwise while visiting to have a chance of less crowd and major attractions for grownups starts from same direction.  See if you feel crowd is more then do go for a express pass as waiting can range from 45 mins to 2 hrs in most of the rides.,Universal Studios Singapore
Lim K,2.0,"February 5, 2020",Staff shortage and poor locker system,"I decided to go for Battlestar Galactica for my first ride and had to put my bag in the nearby locker with a time limit expiry. The ride broke down halfway through my queue. In the end, the waiting time which was supposed to be 45 mins came up to be nearly 2 hours as they keep letting express pass holders through instead of clearing those who were stuck during the breakdown. Upon returning to the locker immediately after the ride, it was locked up due to expiry of time limit and I was forced to pay a fine to retrieve my belongings despite trying to explain the situation to the locker crew. There weren't any staff that could redress such issues at the BSG. There weren't any staff available along the way as well and I have to make my way all the way back to the ticket entrance customer service. And there was such a long queue that the usher outside the office advised me to come back later.  Basically, it is compulsory to place all your belongings in lockers located near the entrance of thrilling rides. I have seen more than a few riders being sent off because they have stuff inside their pockets just before their turn for the ride. You will definitely be bored to death while queuing more than 60 minutes without your mobile phone and stuff, especially if you are a single rider. So be mentally prepared.",Universal Studios Singapore

I was lucky enough for my husband to buy us fast track tickets which definitely really helped; especially with rides such as transformers and the mummy ride. The food was not great and quite overpriced but other than that I really enjoyed it.

Sanjay,5.0,"January 28, 2020",Universal studios,"The universal studio at Singapore is really superb. You need one full day if you want to see everything . The main problem with sentosa island including universal studio at Singapore is that there is no public relations booth and the visitors are left in the dark with no one to give/ inform directions. With this type of infrastructure and with so much money flowing the management should have couple of public relations booth at all places to guide visitors which today's date is completely lacking. Please do not go on Friday to Sunday as for each ride the waiting period would be more than two hrs which is quite irritating. If a visitor is buying tickets it is better to pay more and get express tickets, as the express tickets entitles a person a priority of entering a ride compared to regular ticket and in the process a person can do all rides . In a regular ticket a person can never complete all the rides due to the enormous queue.",Universal Studios Singapore

Yash S,5.0,"January 26, 2020",Full of Thrill & Excitement,"First thing first, if you are going during vacay time, I would recommend to book the tickets in advance.  Secondly, if you are impatient to stand in long queues then go for express entry, this will increase the cost by 1.5 times. With express entry you would be able to do all the rides. If you do not take express entry still you can manage to do 4 major rides: Human, Cyclone, Transformers & Revenge of the Mummy. These four rides are must.  Also, do not miss Water World Show. It is fabulous. It takes place at specific time, so make sure to reach 15 minutes before it starts to get good seats else if you have express entry. If you do not wish to get wet, then sit at the back because there would be surprise in for you.  After these five activities, if time permits, go for Jurassic Adventure.  As we had taken express tickets, we did Human & Cyclone twice.",Universal Studios Singapore
hervor,5.0,"January 25, 2020",VIP for a great day,"Booked VIP tickets through Klook for myself and my husband. The day started in a very crowded and chaotic 'VIP lounge' so busy there wasn't a place to sit and I stood filling out the paperwork being jostled by people. The two of us were paired with a family of three, who were very nice, but were interested in different things to us (we wanted to do all the thrillseeker rides and not interested in shopping, photo ops or kid stuff).  Our guide Man Xuan was excellent. Not only did she arrange our day based on what we wanted to do, she held our bags while we went on rides, made sure we got the best seats, and made suggestions for things to do, where to eat and where to sit at the activities based on our preferences. The longest we waited for a ride was for the previous one to end and this is why the VIP price was completely worth it.  We were at the park for 6 hours (10-4) and the guide was with us for the entire time, except for a lunch break. In that time we went on every ride we wanted, Transformers and the roller coasters were excellent and we loved the hilariously enjoyable Shrek 4D show. It's a small park but we couldn't have done everything we wanted without the 'skip all the queues' VIP pass. The other family left the tour for a couple of hours to go and do things they wanted to do, which is probably not ideal when you have paid for VIP.  I'd never been to a theme park before and wasn't sure I'd like it but absolutely loved it! We had a fantastic day and highly recommend the VIP to really get the most of the park, but yeah, be aware you might be paired up with others with different ideas about what a great day at the park looks like.",Universal Studios Singapore
maria_platt,3.0,"January 25, 2020",Fun...but disappointing,"First time visiting USS and while it was fun I wouldn't go again. We got there at 9.40am and gates were open and so got on to a few rides with no queing. But then the ques became quite long and there was no staff to manage the line or direct people as there was confusion about what was express line and regular line (E.g. sesame street). Also staff were letting just 2 people onto 4 seater carriage and so some rides were not being used to full capacity despite 1 hour wait. I think some revision of how ques are managed is required as no one really wants to wait an hour for a ride that lasts less than 5 mins.  Our 7 yo is not into roller coasters or high rides so after about 3 hours we were done and I left feeling underwhelmed.  As a family experience it was fun, however I think it is expensive and to pay a substantial amount extra for express tickets is not fair when base ticket price is already $80. With better management of the park I think some of the inefficiencies could be avoided and the park experience improved.",Universal Studios Singapore
priyanka m,1.0,"January 25, 2020",Malfunction rides too much Rush,Not worth the amount of money spent as we had to wait more then 120 min (Jurassic park)for a ride and later it was communicated that they had brake down Same thing with two more rides (water world) & (transformer ) No use of having express pass Better not to carry any bags as we need to keep them at every second attraction in the paid lockers The app works well so follow the app to avoid last minute rushing around,Universal Studios Singapore

2to1,3.0,"January 24, 2020",Good but tiring,"As an adult I wouldn’t choose to visit here but had to take my daughters. Everything was as expected: long queues in hot weather. 7 hours on our feet. Only did about 7 rides. At the end of the day we chose to go as single riders because you can jump the queue. The only thing is that you won’t be able to ride together but it’s worth it to beat the queues. They need to provide more drinking fountains and water sprays. The donkey live show was disappointing. Just a cartoon caricature. The 4D shrek show was very entertaining. My girls were disappointed that there was no Harry Potter World. The food was very limited. If you’re a health fanatic there’s nothing for you except water. All fried fast food. We were so happy to eat a salad once we got out of there. All in all, it is a must do for your kids, but only once. Otherwise save this opportunity for the true Universal studios in America.",Universal Studios Singapore

B311y,3.0,"January 23, 2020",Children had a good time and busy,"The children had a good time! It was very busy! We had to wait for over an hour for most of the rides! We didn’t do all the rides due to waiting for so long. Advised to buy express pass if you can afford it! Buy it few days in advance as the price seems double if you buy it at the entrance. Customer service needs improving. If you decide to leave the Universal studio please bring the ticket even though you get stamp it doesn’t count. They staff initially refuse to let me in as I didn’t have my ticket. My partner has the ticket on his phone. The staff wanted my partner to bring the ticket who happens to be lining up for the rides over an hour with my two children, which I had to explain to her and pretty much begged to let me in. I was not happy person. The staff eventually let me in when she requested evidence of the photo on my phone that I been inside. Another complaint is my partner wanted to sit down on the bench who has swollen feet but was told to move as he will be in the way because photo getting taken, even though there was big wheelchair next to the bench. It was hard waiting for long period just to go the rides with two little children who is getting grumpier due to waiting for long periods just to go to the rides. The weather didn’t help it was hot and humid. There is no chair to sit down while your waiting for over an hour. If you can afford it buy express pass. What makes it worse there was a young boy who had express pass went on the same ride 8 times while there is lots of people who has been waiting for over an hour. Maybe have a time frame when that person can come back or limit entrance to 2-3 times just to make it fair for everyone who has been waiting for so long.",Universal Studios Singapore
Nyx007,4.0,"January 23, 2020",Unforgettable fun experience,"We visited Universal studios on Christmas eve and we were lucky to have bought the express pass online. I certainly recommend anyone visiting the park during peak seasons to book the express pass as normal queues tend to be longer with waiting time of more than 1hr. The express pass queue is shorter and we could make the most of our day at USS. We reached there at around 10.30. Staffs were nice and greeted us politely. We managed to do most of the activities by the end of the day. Our favorite ones were the revenge of the mummy and the transformers ride. The revenge of the mummy ride is more intense but also much more thrilling. We arrived at the Shrek attraction at noon. As the weather was hot and humid, we bought delicious vanilla ice creams at the stall just opposite to the castle. In the afternoon we went for Elmo's tv time show which was mostly for young children. The show was beautifully performed in a comfortable air-conditioned hall. In short, we enjoyed each second spent at the park and we will definitely come back.",Universal Studios Singapore

Also, the size of this park makes it convenient and not tiring to walk.  Food options could be improved. Cafetarias menu could be improved. Snack concessions could also use some improvement.  The only sore point and glaring negative aspect were actualy the staffs. More than 50% of the staffs were actually rude. They seemed like they were being forced to do their jobs, thus they took it out on customers/visitors by showing their terrible attitude.

It was really impressive from the minute we walk through the gates till the minute we depart feeling so ecstatic & satisfied. The entertainment was fun filled the show staff the ride staff, everyone here made you feel valued and participate in the super happy fun atmosphere. A real credit to the entire park team! The Universal Studios Singapore fast pass system for those wishing to max out there riding experience is ABSOLUTELY FANTASTIC VALUE FOR MONEY. I felt I rode all the best rides many times the gobsmackingly thrilling Battlestar Gallactica Cylon vs Human rollercoaster, the Mummy, The Flying Dinosaur, and all the amazing rides. The parks wonderfully friendly engaged staff worked hard and actively kept things moving at a suitable pace in keeping with demand. The food outlets served up generous food portions there were no waitimes for a pretzel or a churro. They new how to get things done fast. Knowing that long queues aspect of a day at a fun park is NOT FUN & virtually unacceptable, they simply didn’t allow it.

This is a medium (or in between small and medium) sized park with some nice attractions.  Tickets a reasonably expensive and we bot Express tickets where we can skip the line. this allowed us to visit many attractions in a short time.

Pizza shop or other reasonable food stall for my lunch.  BTW, if u bought your discounted tickets on line, remember go to the LOCKER BOOTH where there are some machines to redeem your printed out vouchers.  It is located near the entrance.

camo72,4.0,"January 19, 2020","Great headline acts, but limited depth","Armed with express passes, our family of four (including two kids, aged 11 and 8) spent a mostly enjoyable day here, in January 2020. It must be said that the park itself - whilst held aloft by a number of truly exceptional rides - is actually quite small... and lacks the depth of thrill rides that one would find at say a Six Flags park in the US.  That said, the rides at the upper echelon of this park are sensational. The first we attacked was Transformers... and what an experience that was. After lining up for 20 odd minutes (even with express passes), this ride did not disappoint. Dizzying video animation, combined with a moving cart makes for a truly unique experience. Hard to explain how effectively stomach-churning some of the 'drops' were... even though you knew the sensation was mostly created by video screens. An absolute must.  After that, I (the others were too scared) braved the Battlestar Galactica: Cylon roller coaster. Just. WOW. As the veteran of many theme parks in my time, this suspended coaster is right up there with the world's best and is - for mine - THE must-do ride in the park. Worth the price of admission alone. The acceleration up the initial climb, and subsequent drop is utterly unbelievable... and the fast loop towards the end of the ride (where you dive into the excavated trench - was sublime. It was so good that I made a point of lining up again, towards the end of the day, just to experience it one more time before leaving. Just as good the second time. Top 3 best coasters I've been on, ever.  I also took a ride on Battlestar Galactica: Human coaster with my 11 year old daughter. Was actually surprised how good this one was too, even without any loops or rolls. The speed (it's slightly faster than Cylon) and tight turns were hair-raising... and we had an absolute blast, laughing and whooping all the way.  The other ride of mention here is the Jurassic Park Rapids Adventure. Despite the lengthy queue (even with express passes, we still needed to line up for 40+ minutes), our whole family thought this was particularly great, and ended up suitably soaked afterwards. Not exactly a thrill ride (although the last bit was definitely thrilling for the kids), but a great family experience.  Other than that, the depth of quality rides thins out a tad. Still plenty to do for younger kids, but not so much so, for those seeking mass adrenaline release (even though what is there, is very, very good). In all, we enjoyed our day out and would recommend it for other families, when in Singapore.",Universal Studios Singapore
techtravel972,1.0,"January 19, 2020",Not value for money or time,"So firstly, this was my first time to a Universal Studios, so didn't have any expectations except that the queues might be a little long. Boy was I wrong about that. Minimum 45 mins to 1.5hrs for each ride is just ridiculous, especially when you have young kids who are just beside themselves standing waiting in the heat. Almost unbearable. The food we had at the diner was horrific. Small, dry barely edible hamburgers. The park itself is ok, but there is no way I'm going back unless I had an Express Ticket. Nothing worse than standing in a line for an hour only to watch someone wanted down next to you in the express line and jump straight on a ride. Without an express pass you barely get to go on any rides.",Universal Studios Singapore
GenkiSensei1,1.0,"January 18, 2020",Poorly run park,"Way too crowded. Minimum 1.5-2 hour wait for each attraction in stifling heat. Queue estimation displays way off to real time waits. Even fast queue system looked long. Need to control gate admissions each day. Food and drinks overpriced. Staff looked exhausted and grumpy. ‘Technical difficulties’ experienced after waiting an hour in line for Battlestar Galactica ride. In a day only went on 3 rides. Gave up and left at 3pm. Had enough. Los Angeles park so much better. Much more spacious. Friendly staff and minimal queues. Even Osaka park was better. Not recommended, save your money and go Japan or USA.",Universal Studios Singapore

Stella T,2.0,"January 18, 2020",Disappointed,"Been waiting for every game for about an hour and only played 3-4 games in a day, what we were disappointed most is that we didn't even get a chance to its must-play games -Jurrasic Park and Transfomer Ride because they all have technical problems at that time! We was waiting in line to play these two and suddenly the staff announced they closed, feel pitty for those who had been waiting for hours and nearly got their turns but have to give up... Hope this won't happen again for travellers who make a long journey to get here but couldn't play anything except waiting and waiting!",Universal Studios Singapore

adventuresofkaymay,5.0,"January 17, 2020",VIP Experience,"Resorts World Sentosa:  We visited Universal Studios, but we also got the VIP experience which I booked through Klook. This meant no line ups at the entrance and no line ups on the rides or shows at all!!!  On arrival you go to the VIP experience waiting room where you are offered a drink and some nibbles whilst they are processing your tickets. Then your guide takes you into the park and has a day planned out for rides and shows.  After the shows you are also given priority to have photos with the characters.  You have the choice of an hour or half an hour lunch break and all this means is that the time with your guide is suspended and concludes after lunch. Included in your VIP ticket is $25 each for food and beverages at most places around the park.  You get 4 hours with your guide, but we were lucky enough to get an extra 50 minutes. After your time has ended you have express passes for the rides and when you show your VIP ticket you get 10% off merchandise.  This was well worth every cent spent to purchase these tickets just to avoid the lines.",Universal Studios Singapore
James C,4.0,"January 17, 2020",Good family day out,Compact and not as large as the other Universal Studios but it’s easy to get around especially with young kids. Some of the rides are a little dated but the children (7 and 12) didn’t notice. Getting the Express Pass for everyone made it quite a bit more expensive but at least you don’t spend up to an hour in a queue. Plenty to do and we spent 7 hours there. The children loved it.,Universal Studios Singapore
tripdreamer1975,3.0,"January 17, 2020",Needs an upgrade for the cost,"The park itself is fine for a full day with kids. But at that cost (adding the express pass without which even on a weekday you can barely enjoy any ride), it seriously needs upgrades, some TLC and some more modern rides.",Universal Studios Singapore
Tatiana L,3.0,"January 17, 2020",Express pass!,"Dont even bother unless you get an Express pass. We went on a weekday and it took on average 1 hour per ride. And the waiting times shown are not always accurate. It was a great time when we were actually doing something, but the ratio of waiting in lines vs being in rides/at attractions stole all the joy from our trip.

But definitely worth the extra bucks.",Universal Studios Singapore
Arnold91,4.0,"January 16, 2020",VIP experience,I did the VIP experience and it was very good. It was a bit pricey but it was well worth the money. I got a personal guide showing me around the park and got to walk right on any ride I wanted. It also included lunch. Would I do it again?

AirFuss,4.0,"January 15, 2020",Awesome but felt like one day not enough,There are so many things to see and do for kids and adults that even with after giving one full day you may feel short of time.  If you do not take the express pass most of your time goes in queuing. So before starting prioritize what you want to do and which character meet and greet you want to attend. Go early when park opens to get on few rides before big queues start building up.  Young kids will also have a lots to do. Each theme part of the park has one or two swings/rides for the kids.,Universal Studios Singapore
erika_da_traveler,5.0,"January 15, 2020",Great for both kids and adults!,"Universal Studios Singapore is a great place to visit when you are in Singapore.  Battlestar Galactica and Transformers are my two favorite rides, both thrilling and exciting at the same time.

Kevin_Mumbai,4.0,"January 15, 2020",Nice day out for a fun family day,Was quite nice overall but definitely leagues off Disneyland.

Sneha M,5.0,"January 15, 2020",My first Universal Studios experience!,"As someone from Mumbai, I was not new to the concept of amusement parks, having Essel World and Imagica in close proximity. But Universal Studios was a different Ball game.  The theme park is full of rides from the popular movies and series from Universal Studios, with the most amazing being the Transformers ride. It takes you into a parallel universe where you are involved in a car chase, you fall off a cliff, pass through water, pass through fire and actually feel the heat. Your heart is beating so fast after this ride!  The other amazing rides here that are not to be missed are the Mummy ride, the experience from Steven Speilberg, Shek, etc. There are a number of restaurants inside Universal if you get hungry, which you will, considering you will be spending a good amount of time there.  One of the best attractions of Sentosa islands, Universal Studios is not to be missed. Oh, and don't forget to get yourself clicked in front of the globe that is the logo of Universal.",Universal Studios Singapore

There was plenty of entertainment around the old diner and we had lunch there just to remind us of the happy days show.,Universal Studios Singapore

As we have previously been to the Universal Studios in Orlando and California, this was rather small and not as fun as the park is much smaller than the others. One thing I have to say is that being one of the major attractions in Singapore the staff and not 1 but most that that we encountered were very very rude and we were extremely disappointed as we never experienced this at the other parks. They rude to an extent that at one ride they yelled at the kids for shrieking in excitement- I mean really?? Another thing we noticed is that besides the transformer robot, there were no other characters - like Non- and we were there all day.",Universal Studios Singapore
Anne Marie @ TYC,5.0,"January 12, 2020",No need to go to US,"If one cannot afford to go to US or want an alternative to Osaka, Universal Studios Singapore offers the same excitement. However, it was super crowded when we went and I guess it was because those who wanted to go to HK Disneyland went to Singapore instead, because of the political crisis in Hong Kong. If one wishes to really enjoy all the attractions, perhaps one needs 3 days to be there. We enjoyed the 4D attraction of Shrek.

There was no where to sit for lunch. Lines everywhere.

Lucky for me I got a one on one experience and went straight to all the front of the busy queues and got a special room at the shows.

Tickets are reasonably priced, The queues can be long ... so be prepared. Or fork out a hefty sum for the fast pass/ express lane that lets you jump the queues.  Arrive early, stay late.

Krutank V,2.0,"January 8, 2020",Chaotic - needs to be better managed,"Yes, i know we visited during one of the busiest periods of the year, but the crowd management was pathetic to say the least. The attendants to the rides were very rude, did not bother to answer to questions asked by the visitors. One ride after a 75 minute wait had a ""technical"" failure which they were unable to tell how long it will take to resolve. Just imagine having waited with your 75 year plus parents for the ride for that long - only to be told - you can chose to enjoy other rides!!! I think this place is designed to work only in a happy path scenario of handling regular load, they cannot deal with heavy volumes. FYI - this is the 3rd Universal i visited after LA and Florida (Those were visited on long weekends as well), but they had much better crowd management abilities. Day wasted and disappointed to say the least",Universal Studios Singapore
Lonino18,5.0,"January 8, 2020",Universal Studios - go early to avoid long queues,"Definitely recommend going. I suggest buying your tickets on the Klook app as are much cheaper and you don’t need to print them out. We bought the half an hour entry ticket but had to wait until it officially opened to go on the rides, however we didn’t need to line up. Queues only seemed to start in the late morning/afternoon on the day we were there.

KC U,5.0,"January 8, 2020",A must visit in SG at least once,"I would suggest buying fast pass during peak days such as weekends and holidays. It would save you a lot of time.  USS is very humid so dress accordingly.  Food is surprisingly good.  I really enjoyed every minute of it. I would say you have to schedule one full day for this.  Make sure to bring clothes especially for the kids because they will need it.  Some rides you might have to leave you bags in a locker area or it would convenient also if someone can watch over your personal items.  Bring cash to be sure. For those of you who are going to ride the Jurassic park, I suggest you bring something that will Keep you dry. They actually sell it there too but just Incase you want to save on money do so.  Get a map! Plan your rides because it will really help you maximise the rides 🙂",Universal Studios Singapore

Monika_Tan,4.0,"January 7, 2020",Good time despite crowded,"Visited USS with grandma in wheelchair and one child. Got tickets from traveloka because could not book from USS official website. E-tickets shown at check in counter.  As arrived ad Sentosa Island, followed signs to USS. All staff are friendly with proper English. Wheelchair is available to rent for $15. Came here during Christmas Holiday. As expected, full of crowd queueing from waiting the gate opened until waited for ride. My family decided not rushing. Been there for 7 hours and surprisingly able got 6-7 ride/show. Christmas theme photo booths were also easily found in every corner with friendly staff with beautiful make-up and costumes. Bought healthy snacking such fruit and red potato for snacking then had late lunch outside at Din Tai Fung.  USS is children favorite place to go in SG. Adult who like adrenaline ride and happy with nice IG picture also might happy to come here. Terminator, Elmo Spaghetti Chase, Puss in Boots, Waterworld and Jurassic World are our favorite ride. Donkey show surprisingly funny and enjoyable. Souvenir shop also nice but not much changed since last visit a year before.  The power of money also ruled here. If you don’t mind spend more money , you might consider to buy additional express ticket to skip the queue. The price might be higher when the demand is higher. I was quite surprised seeing a lot of tourists bought $120 and $140 express tickets, which that is the price around 11 am. Price might go higher later.

The place offering a lot of adventures, but traveling in big group family making a little bit difficult to stop at every attraction in one visit. No need to comment about the attractions because they are amazing, however, some tip might come handy: - eat before you go in. You’ll be starving anyway if you try to go event half of the attraction, but if you already eat outside, you might not by so much inside, because the price is very high in my view. - lots of water fountain, you can sip. Or maybe fill your Universal Tumblers (its good merchandise though) - come as early as you can - enough sleep the night before, stamina is needed Have Fun!!",Universal Studios Singapore

anton a,4.0,"January 6, 2020",Very good Park-Mind the lines,Located in Sentosa island universal studios is a very nice place to visit especially for families.First of all to visit sentoza island there are 3 ways .1)By train:metro to harbourfront and then sentoza express which leaves you right outside the universal park. 2)By cable car:From harbourfront or mount faber to sentoza island but i do not know how close it is to the park. 3)I think there is the option to walk from harbourfront station.Not completely sure but i think its possible. Anyway best option is the Sentoza express. Now for the park. The MOST IMPORTANT tip i can give:Buy the skip-the line ticket.Its not difficult to get in Universal studios but if you get the normal one you will have a very hard time to get in the rides or other attractions since the lines pile up to even 70-90mins of waiting time.That was my only negative but is something that exists in places like this.Very nice experience that will ring familiar to people that have grown up with films like Jurassic park and Shrek and know what battlestar galactica is .You can get in and just walk around and you will still feel it was worth it.,Universal Studios Singapore
Knight168,4.0,"January 6, 2020",A Major Attraction That Needs Maintenance,"To my surprise, the size of the attraction is not that big but the number of activities and programmes are definitely sufficient to last throughout the day. Equal share of thrilling and non-thrilling rides means it is suitable for all ages to have fun at USS.  The setback - food and beverages in there are madly expensive. Will advice those who are going to USS to grab a bottle of drink before going in. Another setback, there were at least 2 rides that had to halt due to technical glitches.",Universal Studios Singapore
Simon88,5.0,"January 6, 2020",Express line ticket- DEFINITELY WORTH IT!,Went to Universal studios Singapore today (Monday 6th of jan). We were advised to not bother with express line tickets mainly because it was not a weekend. We lined up for an 1.5 hours for one of the main roller coasters first thing in the morning while watching express line ticket holders pass us in the dozens. It took them easily a quarter of the time to get on. Straight after the ride we went straight to the ticket box and paid the $80 each and didn’t regret it for a second. EXPRESS IS WORTH EVERY CENT! Don’t believe other reviews or people telling you not to bother. Trust me! Enjoy!  Ps. If we hadn’t bought express we wouldn’t have been able to experience everything they had to offer. There is ALOT to see and do! Cheers.,Universal Studios Singapore

Caps09,4.0,"January 5, 2020","Must Visit, but also expensive","This was my first visit to Universal Studios, Singapore. I visited in the last week of Dec and it was full of many visitors. I was expecting massive visitor rush and did found one. The best thing i did was that i also purchased the Express Pass which helped me to beat the long queues of approx 90-100 mins to 20-25 mins. Generally with Express pass one tends to get into rides immediately. Please do remember to do Transporter ride as it is a Must ride. Also do remember to also attend the WaterWorld Show at 1530/1730. Pls do remember to carry water bottles as you can use them and refill them at various locations. Remember to reach early at the venue 0930-1000. Toilets too are available throughout the park. Pls carry sunscreen, caps & shades to beat the sun. Be prepared to walk a lot and wear comfortable walking shoes. For Waterworld show if you sit in front, there are chances that you might get wet.

ardena2015,3.0,"January 4, 2020",Highly Recommend Private VIP Tour,We have a great time with the private tour guild. She is very funny and with great sense of humour. She had to take care two family’s group. The other group of 3 from Indonesia and we were from Canada. Both the family are very accommodating as whether to take others ride or stop for rest or skip other ride ..... is very good team and the guild have no problem with us.  She explained many of the ride history and some hidden story behind the ride and now they were build. She alway ask us to drink more water in case dehydration and telling us it very hot weather ........ she also prepare rain coat for the Jurassic water ride ..... very thoughtful of her.  I would highly recommended take the private VIP tour is way way better than the express lane ........  Although this universal studio cannot compare with the US studio on the size ..... but the VIP tour guild are 100% way better than those guild in US. Keep this up ..........  Remember to tips the VIP guild after ..... they really work hard to make us feel at home.,Universal Studios Singapore
sanjay_d2000,3.0,"January 4, 2020",Not idle on Holiday seasons.,"I went to Universal Studios last Chrismas 2019. You have to buy a full day pass S$80 approx for all rides . But or each ride on a holiday average waiting time is 120 min. We could only finish 2 to 3 rides. But the ride Transformer and Revenge of Mummy are exceptional. But I think all rides are inpossible for tourist who visit Singapore on Holidays. The irony is you cannot chose your ride and pay in Universal Studio, but pay for all and ride only a few",Universal Studios Singapore

James Pole,2.0,"January 3, 2020",Either get the Express Pass or do not go at all,"I had a great experience doing a number of different rides. However what was disappointing to me was that I waited between 30 to 90 minutes before every single ride. This meant I only managed to do a few rides and missed out on several rides I wanted to do. This was despite arriving early on what I hoped would be a quiet day. They let so many people in that if you don't have the Express Pass you will spend the majority of your time just waiting in queues for up to 90 minutes. This was so offputting that I would not recommend this theme park unless you are willing to pay for the ticket plus the Express Pass add on. If you want to go you need to weight up your options between (a) buying the Express Pass and hopefully getting your money;s worth or (b) consider not going at all and do other activities within Singapore that are better use of your money and time. If you are willing to risk skipping the Express Pass option, at least try and get in as early as possible and do your research beforehand so you do the popular rides first before the queues build up then do the least popular rides later.",Universal Studios Singapore
Suraj Nayak,4.0,"January 3, 2020",Fun day at Universal Studios Singapore,"Pro tip 1: Get the Express pass if it is in your budget. The price of the express pass varies based on demand. Pro tip 2: Pre-book your tickets to get discounts/offers including mastercard exclusive offers on the rwsentosa site. Pro tip 3: If you dont have the express pass go for the Singles line to experience the attractions faster wherever this option is available.  This is a fantastic amusement park - especially for someone who has not visited any other Universal studios or other similar famous parks. It is located on Sentosa island.  Some of our favorite rides which are a ""must ride"" were the Mummy, Transformers and the Battlestar Galactica rollercoasters. Lots of photo opportunities were there throughout the day with different movie characters.  They also provide free lockers outside rides to store your belongings.",Universal Studios Singapore

Alison Vor,1.0,"January 2, 2020",Overrated,"Lets start with the positives; Incredible infrastructure, the rides all look amazing and the different worlds and shops all looked beautiful!  We went on Monday January 30th 2019, we knew it was school holidays but was hoping it’s a Monday so it wouldn’t be as crazy as the weekend. However.....The lines for everything was ridiculous, 2 hour wait and even 1 hour wait for some rides on express.  Wasn’t the best experience....it started off with us buying our tickets at invivo mall. When we arrived we were told to line up at guest services for our ticket. After waiting 30 minutes- we get to the front of the line and the lady tells us we didn’t need to line up and can go straight in- there was a lot of confusion with staff and poor communication.  Once your inside it was just people-people-people- lines-lines-lines.  You will need a lot of patience if you decide to go.  You are allowed pass outs, so we left at 1pm and came back at 5pm but waiting time was still over an hour. They are open 10am- 9pm- so you could try going later in the evening.  There is a lot to do on sentosa island, zip lining, cable cars, beach and food places- which would probably be more of an enjoyable experience.",Universal Studios Singapore

Overall felt there were issues, the Transformer ride had technical issues for most of the day and then the mummy ride had issues. We had express tickets and that helped with the experience.

rkdubey,1.0,"January 2, 2020",Pathetic park and terrible experience,"Having traveled and seen other amusement parks around the world, this one by far is the worst adventure park in terms of number of rides they offer, the area the park is spread in, the money they charge and the facilities they offer (including the locker facilities).  We took express ticket and still had to wait upto 90 mins for the rides - why to take express tickets(?) and pay significantly more, when there is no upside to it. Worse is in certain situations the express queues were longer(!).  Secondly, USS needs to think about the footfall. Clearly, in order to make money, they do not cap the number of guests whom the tiny, little USS park can accommodate. What we saw was a clear failure of USS to deliver the experience tourists come for.  Lastly, the rides were shut mid-day on account of some drizzle. I totally understand that it is for our safety. But then there was no clarity on when they will start the rides. As a result, a lot of people were stuck in stuffy rooms trying to get a chance to ride. Looking at their sufferings and total lack of clarity from USS on when the rides will resume, I felt that I should NOT have come to this place at all. It is not the money which i lost (which ofcourse I feel bad about) but what i saw in those waiting rooms that made me feel far more worse.  My piece of advice to anyone who is reading this and plan to visit USS, Singapore. Please avoid this place. There are better adventure parks elsewhere, they may offer a better bang for the buck - BUT CLEARLY THIS IS NOT THE PLACE.",Universal Studios Singapore

What a rip off! And the fast pass queue for one of the rides was 30 minutes.

TK1,3.0,"January 1, 2020",Universal studios Singapore- May be good for families with small kids but not worth much for adults,"Visited in December 2019  Pros: -3 amazing rides viz The mummy returns, The transformers and the cyclone. - Reasonable sized theme park that can be covered in a day - Casino experience where you will eventually lose your money  Cons: - Dull rides and experiences other than 3 rides mentioned in pros. Anyone older than 12 years will get frustrated. - Even after paying full ticket charge, they will try to charge you for locker and splash protection at couple of rides. I find it unethiCal as facilities within ticket should be commensurate with ride types covered.  Summary: Would i go again-NO. Was it worth an experience as a solo traveller- probably YES but only because of 3 rides and casino experience, considering that there isint much to see in Singapore otherwise.",Universal Studios Singapore
Cheno,3.0,"January 1, 2020",Smaller than the usual Universal Park,"Singapore is fairly restricted by land are size hence the park needing to be smaller. If you've never been to a universal them park then this is a good place to start, however if you've been to one in the US you will be disappointed. There are some great rides, the park is well maintained and is easy to get to. Dress for extreme heat and humidity, bring water with and be ready to braves crowds. Pro tip - try going after lunch, the park is somewhat less full.  Cons: - If you're Vegan - eat before you come. There is no vegan friendly cuisine - Small - If you do not have an express pass you will end up waiting up to an hour per ride on busy days  Pros - Not too pricey - Clean - Well organised",Universal Studios Singapore

Price gouging on lockers on certain rides (no caps/small handbags/any bags/phones etc) free 20mins then $4 upwards, no issue in Fl. It makes for unpleasant day.

We could do only three to four rides as the waiting hour didn’t allow us to do more. On top of everything, if we wanted to have an express card which meant not waiting, we had to have a separate budget for it! Never have we waited so much n this has tested our patience! This place was so crowded on top of it. I can’t find anything nice to say.",Universal Studios Singapore
NellyPerth,1.0,"December 31, 2019",Great day for waiting in lines,We visited Universal Studios yesterday. What a masssive disgrace! We spend over $75 each to go one one ride. Management seriously need to get their act together and appreciate that no customer should have to wait in lines for over 2 hours to receive something they have paid for. We expected it to be busy but it was an absolute joke. Rides out of order and ridiculous queues. As a business universal should limit the number of guests so people get what they have paid for and an enjoyable theme park experience. Would not recommend.,Universal Studios Singapore
fubeca,2.0,"December 31, 2019",NOT worth it on a holiday. We'll never return!,"3 years ago we did Universal Studios Hollywood on a July weekday. Crowded but not overwhelming. Universal Studios Singapore on the 30th of December was pretty bad! We knew it would be crowded but had to go while the cousins were visiting. We shouldn't have! It was ridiculously crowded. We assumed we could just buy express passes for the day. Splurge on the fast pass. But when we went to buy the express pass it turned out to be more than DOULBE the cost of the ticket to get in. So we didn't buy them. But then spent the day irritated at the express pass line. ha ha. Because they'd put the express pass people on 2 or 3 full coasters before loading the regular lane. EVERY ride was 2 hours or more. It was ridiculous. Sometimes we are at theme parks where the best ride is that long, but yesterday was just frustrating. Nothing felt worth the long lines. 2.5 hours for transformers. A really cool ride that we love, but by the end of 2.5 hours in line, nobody cares anymore. Everyone is tired and irritated. The ride doesn't feel quite as cool after THAT long of a wait. The whole experience was made even more irritating because the times on the map on the APP were totally off. The times at the rides were often off. Many rides posted times a good 20 minutes LESS than the time it actually took. On the map on the APP it would say 30 minutes. So we ran to ride Human. It took 80 minutes. Human is NOT worth 80 minutes. It's a regular rollercoaster. SO not worth a long wait. Cylon rollercoaster was AWESOME and is worth a long wait. We waited 2 hours and had SO much fun on it, it made the wait feel almost worth it. Human was NOT worth it! The kids were excited all day to go on Jurassic Park. We waited all day for the line to go down. Even at 8:30pm it was still a 100 minute wait and so it was going to have to be the last ride. The kids were disappointed to not ride but opted to go ride a couple of other rides instead of waiting so long yet AGAIN, for just that 1 ride. We did about 4 rides in 8 hours. At 2:30pm we tried to stop for lunch. Every place completely packed so we got corndogs at a stand. At about 5:45 we finally stopped to get some real food. In Jurassic Park area my brother had gone an hour earlier to find and save us tables and we ate potato wedges and chicken satays that were actually quite good. And we got to sit for a while. We never did get to see Madagascar land or minion land or shrek land. We didn't get to go to any shows. Because we spent ALL DAY in lines. The expresspass price at this park increases as more express passes sell. In other words, it's affordable if you are the first ones to buy the expresspass for that date. But if you wait until a few days before, it becomes ridiculously expensive. It is definitely NOT an amusement park worth hundreds of dollars! The firework show at the end was really nice. Well done! The APP is terrible. the lines were NOT worth it. As others have said, only go to this park on a weekday during off season. It's just not worth it on a holiday. Also, it was really annoying that they never had single rider lane open. I'm not sure why not???? i thought maybe there was a good reason until I was looking at the ""rollercoaster"" pictures of several rides after we'd ridden them and noticed that every coaster car would have several empty seats. And they weren't filling them with single riders??? strange! AND the workers were NOT loading people into lanes, for quick loading of the rides. The ride would pull up and unload and the workers were just then ushering people into lanes. Then loading them. it would all go a lot faster if they had people in lanes READY to load right when the coaster car pulled up and emptied. Like other theme parks we've visited. And having fast passes like Disney or a functioning APP would be great. We live in JB across the border in Malaysia and thought about buying a season pass. We will definitely NOT be doing that!",Universal Studios Singapore
Danjuma O,5.0,"December 31, 2019",Almost Awesome!,"The long wait in line can be a serious drag. Unless you’ve got the express pass or are very early. Strongly recommend the Transformers ride, Battlestar Galactica and the Revenge of the mummy.",Universal Studios Singapore
JasonOst,3.0,"December 31, 2019","Unless you pay a premium, you'll be waiting in lines 90% of your day.","First, the positive: this park is very different from the one in Hollywood. For that reason, this was a unique experience. The staff were mostly friendly. Getting there was convenient and the surrounding resort has a lot of options. That said, the guest experience is particularly lacking due to structural issues (especially regarding their queue system).  It's clear that Universal Studios Singapore places a greater emphasis on its profit margin than it does on guest experience; this is not surprising (it's a business after all) but notable considering the effort its competitor (Disney parks, specifically) places on ensuring its guests don't feel gipped and get their money's worth.  Wait Times: Expect to wait at least 40 minutes for each ride, even if the wait time displayed is significantly less. The display is almost never accurate and sometimes feels deliberately misleading. Here's an example:  The Mummy ride showed a wait time of 25 minutes. Locker rentals nearby are free for 45 minutes, and at least $4 once that's exceeded. Thinking we'd be able to make it in and out of The Mummy in time, we placed our possessions in the locker and immediately went into the line. The wait ended up being an hour long, and we ultimately had to pay to get our items out of the locker. --  The 'skip the line' pass they sell on top of the admission ticket to the park is the only real way to avoid the long waits. Unfortunately due to every single ride having an express line, non-express users are completely screwed regardless of what they want to do, and there's no reliable way to efficiently maximize your time.  --  Attractions are average and generic; the Puss in Boots Giant Journey ""roller coaster"" (it does not deserve being called such) was particularly disappointing. Food inside the park was overpriced; you'd be much better off exiting the park and eating somewhere else in the Sentosa resort.  -- Ultimately, this is a park you don't need to revisit once you've experienced it. Until they rework their queue system so that guests don't feel like second-class citizens if they don't pay the premium skip the line feature, I think I've got the gist of the place and won't be returning.",Universal Studios Singapore

We had read about the two hr waiting lines for each ride but made the mistake of thinking its exaggerated...its not!! The park has no ration on the number of tickets it seems and minimum 45 mins is the waiting time for even the basic rides.. our worst Amusement park experience ever... maybe its the holiday season but still not worth it as the park is way small compared to even the HongKong Disneyland.

We finished the day watching Water World and whilst we did enjoy this show, the queue to get in and the resultant stampede on opening was very dangerous and it won’t be long before someone gets hurt. We did not have an Express Pass which I kind of regretted, but even then the queues for express pass holders were quite long.

SCSW-Simon,1.0,"December 30, 2019",Undersized and overrated,"What a god awful experience! Only for those with low expectations and who don't mind queueing in the heat! We had a pre-purchased pass and had to queue for about 30 minutes at guest services to redeem (although the queue to actually buy tickets was much worse). Just a short 10 minute queue to actually then get in where you find gift shop after gift shop interspersed with over iced food and drink outlets before eventually getting to rides and attractions. They put up an estimate of wait time for each, with almost all 60 minutes plus, and the worst 120 minutes. I don't care how good a 90 second ride is, I am not going to queue for two hours for it! All rides have Express queues, but the sale price of an express pass seems to be demand driven. The brochure mentioned $30 but the actual selling price of express passes when we were there was $160 per person. This to me seems like gouging! Universal Studios seems to epitomise Sentosa, seemingly designed by an accountant on a box ticking exercise. Yes it has rides, themes, souvenirs and food and drink, but it is small, congested and poor! It might be ok at some time when it's quiet, but personally I would avoid it like the plague.

@anniepfeiffer,1.0,"December 30, 2019",Honestly there were no highlights!,My sisters and I were very excited to attend universal studios in singapore this year as we hadn’t been in a long time. From the past experience we all loved it as it was in a reasonable price range andthe express pass which we usually bought skipped queues meaning we only had to wait around 10 minutes. However today if I said it was terrible would be an understatement. The price has rapidly increased which I was disgusted by how much it cost for the 3 of us for an express pass in which we still had to wait up to an hour in the queues. Yes I understand that it is a busy time period as it is holidays and new years around the corner however at least limit the number of people buying these passes. In 4 hours we managed to complete 4 rides with this “express pass” however it really doesn’t sound like one. I would say we all were very disappointed and would have preferred to save our pennies and do something more enjoyable. I usually hate complaining but really I was extremely disappointed with our i experience.,Universal Studios Singapore

AJUK55,1.0,"December 29, 2019",Universally Disappointing,"OK, let’s put this in perspective. It’s Christmas and school holidays so we expected Universal to be busy. However we didn’t expect two out of the first four rides we tried to be closed with maintenance issues ( both opened later with massive queues); food stalls lacking basic provisions; tired and rundown finish on buildings and footpaths; queues of over 140 minutes for certain rides. We paid SG$960 (usd700) for four adult tickets including unlimited fast pass. (We tried to buy them online to get residents’ and student discounts but none of the selections fitted our situation, so after queuing for 30 mins we had to pay full price for all).We were there seven hours and went on seven attractions. Is this good value? Not in my book.  A lot of external fittings are showing their age and corrosion is rife in many areas. I would like to assume that vital systems are better maintained.  The restaurant we went to essentially threw the cold (supposed to be hot) food at us. Staff had no interest in discussing issues, due either to limited English or a lack of interest.. We live in Singapore and had not been to Universal for years, due to relative mediocrity last time. After this experience, not only will we not return, but we will now also advise others to avoid, hence this post. If you must visit: 1. Buy tickets online if you can; 2. Avoid any holiday. 3. Check maintenance schedule; 4. Probably avoid fast pass purchase; 5. Have low expectations; 6. Watch the Waterworld show, as it almost rescues the previous six hours..  Fool me once, shame on you. Fool me twice, shame on me.",Universal Studios Singapore
Lulusfamily,2.0,"December 29, 2019",Never again,"So last day in Sentosa with 3 boys (12, twin 9) and hey lets go to Universal Studios for a fun day. Wrong. Queuing for over 1.5 hour per ride, technical difficulties delays, stinky people in line, unfriendly staff, warm water for sale, I could go on and on but suffice to say never again, more fun by the pool with a beer.

Ride waits were double the advertised times, yhen you couldn't access the lockers as you'd gone over the time. $70 entry then a fast pass was $110, ridiculous. The rides are old and quite dull. For a whole day we ended up on three rides. Merch was expensive and not the best quality.",Universal Studios Singapore
davidlamtraveller,5.0,"December 29, 2019",Miracle,"We visited Universal studios in Singapore frequently so we expected no surprise for long time. I was afraid of height and speed so I seldom took roller coasters. In this Christmas, my wife instructed me to accompany my son to take the roller coaster in Jurassic park. It was really a challenge for me even though it belonged to junior level. I completely lost my control to cry during the ride because the safety belt loosened during the trip. It was really exciting to travel without the safety belt. Luckily the safety bar was still working. It was really a miracle to land safely . Merry Christmas",Universal Studios Singapore
SammyOfFinland,3.0,"December 29, 2019",Hardly worth the money,"We were expecting much more from our visit. The attractions are nothing special, the beef are the shows. We did queue one hour to the roller coaster until a technical problem occurred and the RC was closed - very nice for the kids...  The area seems very small actually. And there was only a very few Universal movie characters available for photos.  Will not visit this place again. Not worth the money!",Universal Studios Singapore
Christoph S,2.0,"December 29, 2019",A rip off,"We paid 237 S$ for 3 adults (children from 13 years of age on are considered adults). We experienced in 4 hours just 4 activities, as all other ones came with waiting times of 45 min up to 70 min, which we did not want to endure. Once inside the park, we realised that there are two categories of customers. Those with normal tickets and those with express tickets, which get priority in the queues. We were not told at the cashier about this, but it‘s definitely recommended under such circumstances. However, you have to pay then 160 S$ per ticket. Besides this, we got cold food at the food court, for 13 S$ per meal. Last but not least, one of the rides was closed and they could not tell when it will open again. When we complained about the overall experience at the guest service, the lady just listened and nodded. On the positive side, the shows are professionally performed and the whole scenery is well done. Nevertheless, it’s an experience not to be repeated!",Universal Studios Singapore

Joanne EF,1.0,"December 28, 2019",Suboptimal experience,"This was my second trip to Universal Studios Singapore, after my first trip when it opened many years ago. Unfortunately, this experience leaves much to be desired and it will be a long time before I choose to return again.  We purchased tickets from the Changi Rewards website, which had to be exchanged upon arrival to USS. The signposting is poor, compounded by the sheer number of visitors to the park obscuring what limited signage there is.  We queued up for 40 minutes before finally exchanging our vouchers for passes. I can only imagine how long people who were in line were waiting for - there were at least 10-12 rows about 40-50 people deep.  We got to the Battlestar Galactica: Cylon ride where we waited for 90 minutes in the standard queue before getting onto the ride. The ride itself was fine, and not dissimilar to how it was when the park first opened.  Stopped for a quick toilet break after and the toilets left much to be desired. Broken toilet seats and wet floors - not exactly an impression of consistent and clean maintenance.  Unfortunately the theme of maintenance does not appear to be a strong suit here. We moved on to the Mummy ride next and where the USS experience continued to disappoint. We waited for 57 minutes in a sweltering queue with very limited air conditioning or even ventilation, only to be told that the ride had to be “urgently evacuated”, leaving a throng of disgruntled visitors.  We are currently in line for the Jurassic Park Rapids ride ... with a wait time of 2 hours.  Clearly USS is aware of the exceedingly excessive wait times as it has introduced both express and express unlimited passes. These are quite pricey and we’re listed for SGD$110 and SGD$140 on the day of our visit. Even so, the express lines on the day of our visit were not much shorter - maybe an hour or so less than the regular line and it was clear from the disappointed looks on the express pass holders that this was not the premium experience they had paid for.  Having been to Universal Studios Japan in June 2019, which undeniably has greater drawcard attractions like Harry Potter World and provided a fantastic experience, it seems a let-down that USS cannot provide anywhere close to a similar experience. Yes the wait times for popular rides at USJ were at times comparable (we waited 2 hours at the start of the day for the Harry Potter ride), but these wait times were remarkably reduced towards the late afternoon and there was always a sense of calm ensuring visitor comfort whilst waiting for each ride.There were also many more food carts and kiosks to stock up on whilst waiting. There were unfortunately more closed kiosks/carts than open on the day we visited.  USS provides a far inferior experience and its infrastructure and commitment to a positive visitor experience appears to have succumbed to the pressures of maximising visitor numbers, with no regard to how it can actually service these guests.  All in all, it is a resounding disappointment not only from myself but from a friend visiting from overseas who remembers USS from better days.  Would advise skipping it unless you are prepared to spend the money for an express pass, and have the patience to wait in lengthy queues under hot and uncomfortable conditions.",Universal Studios Singapore

I myself visited the amusement park in early December and in the middle of an intense rainstorm (which had the advantage that all queues suddenly disappeared). Universal Studios is now available in several locations around the world and I can only compare with that Florida (Orlando) park which is significantly larger and more varied in its content - but there is also much the same. As a 10-year-old, this is the heavenly realm of fun, fun, fun! As an adult, you also have a lot of exchange, but maybe also get tired of all the sounds and slightly over-ambitious exposures of different film themes ... The best theme is Jurassic Park, Den Mummy and Shrek. However, avoid several of the souvenir shops...you don't need to buy anything!",Universal Studios Singapore

In some of the rides the Express queue was longer than a normal queue. Nothing much for the toddlers. The slightest of drizzle and all the rides are suspended. Within the premises also along side almost all rides, one has to take lockers on rent (with rentals as high as 4 SGD per ride). Above all, our new iPhone was stolen during our visit. Seems pickpockets frequent this place. So be careful with your gadgets and money.  Overall, a very disappointing experience. Can be easily avoided with no regrets.

We queued 1.5 to 2 hours for each ride in the afternoon. Nearing 6PM, more people left the theme park, we spent like 15min queueing for one ride.

Sharon F,5.0,"December 25, 2019",VIP Experience,"We had the most amazing day with the VIP experience tickets. We were welcomed into the VIP reception and offered cold drinks and was introduced to our guide for the day Cassandra. Our VIP tickets had pictures of Minions on which I had put down as a request for a meet and greet. It was little touches like this that helped make our day. Cassandra offered us a map of the park and explained what we would do in the tour and booked our meet and greet sessions. Cassandra explained that another family might join us (as the tour can have up to 12 people) however we weren't phased by this. Our first part was only the 3 of us and then the other family joined us.  The VIP Experience allowed us to walk straight onto the rides, even rides that aren't included in the unlimited express tickets. We were the first to do our meet and greets - we choose Transformers and Minions. The tickets included unlimited passes so after the tour finished we were able to choose which rides we wanted to back onto plus a $25 meal voucher per person. We went on 9 rides plus the adults were offered the opportunity to go onto the Battlestar Galactica. There was a VIP room at the Waterworld show which was welcoming with a cold drink. I highly recommend the pizzas at the Italian place, they are huge and filled our family of 3. We had booked the 10am tour and it finished at 4pm as the guide has an hour lunch break during the day. Cost wise it worked out only slightly more expensive than purchasing the entry ticket, unlimited pass plus the $25 per person food. The ticket was slightly discounted due to a promotion they had on if you pay for the VIP tickets via a Mastercard. We truly had a fantastic day and I would highly recommend the VIP experience.",Universal Studios Singapore

After breakfast at Murgan idli ( Sayad Ali road - Mustafa center) grab taxi to Vivo city mall. Take funpass and go by sentosa Express. Must go rides at Universal: Revenge of Mummy. Battlestar Galactica Transformers the ride. Jurassic Park Rapid adventures (you get wet in this ride so you may buy raincoat for 3$ at the spot or pay 5$ for drying pod where 4 can get in at a time. Or take turns. For kids who love adventure dont miss "" Amber Rock Climb"" good for age 10yrs and above. Waiting time for rides will be 40min to an hour during vacations so plz avoid weekends.

Reccommended ONLY with the purchase of Express Pass and ensure that your children are above 130cm to enjoy all of the rides.  Reached 1pm and make our way to the exit at exactly 10pm. A total of 9hrs inclusive of heavy downpour for about 1-2hrs.  Do take note that ALL prices are rediculously expensive so enter after a meal or two. Bring along water bottles. There's water cooler for refills.  A can of coke costs $4. A 3 piece chicken meal costs $18.50 from Goldilocks. A donut from StarBot Cafe costs $6. A scoop of Ben&Jerry's costs $7.  Revenge of Mummy was insanely drop dead crazy. My heart was missing somewhere along the ride. If you're an adrenalin junkie, take this.  Everything else was awesomely good!

There are no rubbish rides all the rides are fun except for two or three kiddy ones. Transformers was perhaps the best alongside canopy ride in Jurassic park... You'll get the rides description anywhere so let me tell you other stuff... I don't recommend elderly people my grandparents were not able to walk such long distances and most others won't too. They could not go into the more thrilling rides because of heart complications... And they eventually left halfway through... Young ones will enjoy a lot of course.

Vortex,2.0,"December 20, 2019","If you like lining up for hours on end, this is the place for you!","Big waste of time and money... If you want to have a good day at Universal Studios, go to the one in America.  The Singapore Universal Studios is small, outdated and extremely overcrowded, not to mention, ridiculously expensive for what it offers.  We spent most of our day here in queues, just lining up in the heat waiting for a sub-par ride or attraction. The worst part is that Universal charges you an exorbitant fee for an ""express pass"" to cut the queue. These suckers who have paid an arm and a leg are guaranteed to ride A LOT and maybe you do get value for money for this pass. However, if you didn't pay for this pass (which is the majority of tourists), you're stuck in line watching these guys skip the line over and over again before your line has even moved one person.  There were regular, unexplained delays in the rides with no warning on how long the wait time would be for the ride to be operational again.  The attractions are so outdated... For example, the Waterworld special effects show... Not only is Waterworld a terrible movie to begin with, but it's from 1995! Families with young children wouldn't even know this movie. Then there's the Battlestar Galactica rollercoasters - sure it was a relatively popular Sci-Fi show in 2004, however, that's 15 years ago... Not appealing to the young audience of children who frequent the park.  Then there's the locker scam. Sure, the lockers are free for a certain time period when you go on a ride, but you may end up paying more money if you get stuck in a line for hours and can't decide if it's worth the sacrifice to leave the line or stay in it since you've been there for so long.  Oh, and we went on a Monday and spent the whole day in lines, only riding 4 attractions... Apparently weekends are even worse...  Overall, don't bother! It's not value for money and there are better things to see and do with your time in Singapore.",Universal Studios Singapore

Bliybliy,3.0,"December 19, 2019",Need to Freshen Things Up,"I was at this place many years ago and when I visited again recently everything is still the same no changes. I was expecting maybe there would be some new rides or maybe at least some Of the shows they will change it but it is exactly the same.  The park is not that big to be honest and if this is your first time then you will probably enjoy the experience there. But if you have visited before and experience all the rides and shows, then it will be kind of boring because it’s the same thing.  The transformers ride is excellent and fun. Too bad they are still using the same story and did not change it with another new storyline. The outdoor roller coaster was closed which is a disappointment. We wants to with the waterworld stunt show which starts at 3.30pm but it was cancelled due to the weather which was going to rain. That’s another disappointment. I think they should start the show earlier. Why must you start so late at 3.30pm? You should have a few shows throughout the day starting in the morning.  Overall i would say this is just above average If you have visited it before. And it will be a good rating if you are there for the first time.

However, visited USJ and USC and just visited Disneyland in Japan, I find that USS can work on its staff. The workers seem to dread being there. They looked jaded and are engaged in their own conversation. One even mentioned that she is changing job is she finds the work ‘monotonous’. Save a few good ones, USS should seriously look into the morale of their staff or else. Perhaps, they should visit USJ or Tokyo Disneyland and see how the staff there works.",Universal Studios Singapore
Hervey2,5.0,"December 16, 2019",Great fun day out,"We were there for the day in late November. We arrived for opening time and was very few people there. By lunchtime it was fairly busy. Express pass is a must have. Even though it wasn't overly busy there were still 50-60 minute wait times on certain rides. If you wanted to see everything in a busy period I doubt you would make it with out an express pass. I guess it depends on the kids age/s as not everything is appealing to small children, so may not be necessary to see everything. Fun for adults too. I have been to the Hollywood one and not a great deal of difference I thought. We enjoyed it.",Universal Studios Singapore

The only thing that i found off putting was the baggage check on entry, great to keep people safe, but it was more a check for contraband in the way of our own food & drinks, which apparently are not allowed, you are expected to pay top $ for it in the venue. Otherwise, it's a great place especially if you are a fan of rollercoasters, which I'm not. We got drenched on the river coaster, and some paid $5 for a person sized blow dry machine.

Front the moment of arrival you really get the VIP treatment, cold drink on arrival and private air conditioned room to watch Waterworld show was a relief in the hot weather. Jasline found us seats for lunch and made sure we got to do and see all we wanted, she was fantastic!

David D,3.0,"December 7, 2019",Bit disappointing - overpriced outlets,"Thursday morning 24th October and we walked across Sentosa Boardwalk to visit Universal Studios on the Island.  We did pre-book our tickets online, so there was no queuing up just turned up at the entrance.  There were some really good parts about and some disappointing bits. Suppose best to deal with the good bits first.  Transformers the Ride, was our first a 3D in the dark, glasses were provided before boarding, this was definitely worth queuing for.  Accelerator was like a adults teacup ride, a bit of fun.  We queued for about 45 minutes to ride on Battlestar Galactica Cyclon, this was white knuckle and lots of screaming.  Did like the Sesame Street and other statues around the place.  Return of the Mummy was one of the attractions we had highlighted that we would like to experience.  The first time we visited we were told the attraction was closed, we were given no indication for how long.  Rather that wait around in the hope that the ride would open soon, we decided to continue to visit other attractions and return here later.  Over a lengthy interval of time we returned here twice only to find the attraction remained closed. The staff there could not say when it was likely to reopen.  Rather disappointingly we decided to give it a miss as it was not likely to reopen on the day.  There was lots of areas covered in black cloth which were being made ready for Halloween.  The Battlestar Galactica Human Ride, the waiting time never changed from 90 minutes, so we did not bother.  We found the Shops around the Park, Big Bird's Emporium, Hello Kitty Studio, Minion Mart, Universal Store and others were grossly over priced.  Definitely more suited for younger visitors with more rides available.",Universal Studios Singapore
Chai Chen,4.0,"December 5, 2019",I loved Universal Hollywood and I loved this Singapore Attraction Too!,"Totally amazing opportunity! I had the chance to visit Universal Studios Hollywood and it was huge! 1 day is not enough. Here in SG, 1 day is enough. There are lots of attractions inside that were also not present / not available in Hollywood the time I visited last year. So for instance, I enjoyed the Transformers 3D because I didn't get the chance to do that before. Not all rides were the same so I really enjoyed the Rides & Attractions as well here in SG. Planning ahead on what to do is really important to maximize the visit. Me and my sis did skip just a few rides that we're really scared of but we almost rode everything. And since we skipped some, we were able to do more of the Meet & Greet events, as well as the Shows available. It was also a great time to visit since it's Christmas season and most shows were themed with Christmas Vibes. There were probably just 1-2 Shows and Meet & Greets that we were not able to take photos with due to cutoff times (after we lined up also, for a little bit). The fan mists were not working and could've probably been turned off instead. It was not that hot but it was still humid, despite a few times it drizzled that day of our visit. Good thing it didn't rain that much, unlike the previous day we were in SG. However, it could be better if more fans were turned on. Best also for visits to happen on weekdays. It was still packed when we visited (on a Wednesday) and at times, we still had to use our ""Universal Express Tickets"" (we bought separately) since there are queue lines - like at the Transformers Attraction, The Pandages Theatre (showing Elmo Time when we visited - lotsa kids & families), Jurrasic park attractions, among others. It could've been better as well if all attractions were following the policies on Universal Express. There were times wherein they treated those with Express and those without it, as same. Like at the ""Lights, Camera ..."" they made us all line up the same even if we had the Express Ticket and it was accepted there supposedly. My sis had the chance to perform with the dancers of the ""Rhythm Truck"" performance. We knew some of them from home - The Streetboys (which I believe is now called The Rockafellas?) and it was amazing! The closing show we saw (""The Christmas Invention"") was a spectacular attraction as well! All the popular characters were dancing, there were lots of light shows, lotsa dancing and props ... it was a great feat to cap the night! Me and my sis really enjoyed it!",Universal Studios Singapore
Emma S,5.0,"December 5, 2019",Fun day and surprisingly not busy,"I took my dad to the park today (first Thursday in December) from 11:30am to 7:30pm. It was a cloudy day, so the weather was perfect! I was expecting the park to be busy as it is the school holidays in Singapore and the weather was good, but I was pleasantly surprised the park wasn't that crowded. I was at Universal Studios Hollywood earlier this year and the wait for rides are usually at least 30 to 40 minutes. The most I had to wait for rides today was 15 minutes. For the Battlestar Galatica, the posted wait time is usually 60 min. But at 5pm, the posted wait time was 5 minutes! I went on Jurassic Park Rapids Adventure in 5 minutes, the posted wait time was 15 minutes.  I'm not much into rides so I went on only a few, but there are many shows to watch. The shows were done really well and performers are all very professional. The mascot Julien from Madagascar did a fantastic job. He's an absolute joy to watch! Staff are helpful and friendly. Don't miss the Waterworld show. There was also snow simulation at ""Hollywood"" at every hour. The light snow fall looks real, just like the light flurries in Canada.  Download the Universal Studios Singapore app for a listing of shows and ride wait times.  Thank you everyone at Universal Studios for making it a fun day for me and most importantly, for my dad.",Universal Studios Singapore
Savella,4.0,"December 5, 2019",Still good but can be better,The rides are well maintained. I hope they will add a few more thrill rides and really spice up their F&B kiosks because the snacks they are selling are quite boring and repetitive. Their unlimited express pass is a huge plus and I highly recommend getting it to maximize your experience at the park. Thumbs up to the crew and performers at the Waterworld show. They remain very dedicated to putting up a great performance even at times when the audience can be icy. I've seen them perform each time I'm there and they never give me an impression that they have a bad day or something.,Universal Studios Singapore

I couldn’t get her name since she just walked away but she was wearing yellow color jacket & Chinese looks, wearing a spec, and a ponytail hair. Just because of we are Japanese, she said several Japanese words towards us such as; “mendokusai” which means troublesome! Thank you so much for your kind words ya.

Abana87,4.0,"December 1, 2019",The Best Kind Of Intervention,"I was worried about visiting Universal Studios Singapore, as my partner is not one for roller coasters or theme parks. In fact he hadn't been on a rollercoaster in nearly 20 years, but I was about to change all that with our trip here. In preparation for our day out at USS, we bought the fast-track passes which more than earned their keep as the wait times for some rides were around forty minutes plus. And this was on a Thursday, too! It also meant that my partner didn't have too much time to stop and think before we found ourselves strapped in. Thanks to the fast-track pass (and my powers of persuasion) my partner and I managed to go on nearly every ride, which given his earlier hesitation I found incredible. We worked our way from the Madagascar rides all the way to the dueling Battlestar Galactica roller coasters, and I couldn't have been more proud. Whether it was the magic of being on holiday or a special something about USS, I can't say for certain, but what I do know is that he can't wait to go to another theme park. Seriously, however, I cannot stress the importance of the fast-track pass.",Universal Studios Singapore

GarethEvans1976,3.0,"November 28, 2019",Slightly disappointing,"My wife and I visited Universal Studios Singapore earlier this month and to our disappointment found that it was slightly underwhelming. Other than a couple of good rollercoasters, Battlestar Gallactica - Human and the Revenge of the Mummy (Transformers ride was closed so we couldnt get on that), the park was a bit lacking in entertainment. A number of the rides, whilst we were queing, also had 'technical issues' which meant we had to re-queue later.

Would recommend the Mango flavoured slush! $7 for the bottle plus drink and refills cost $5 thereafter.  However travellers please be aware of pickpocketing.

Stakar12,5.0,"November 27, 2019",VIP experience worth every cent,"Based on previous reviews l was sceptical about whether l had made the right decision doing USS VIP experience- it is now one of my most treasured memories. From the moment we arrived we certainly felt like we were the only two people in the park. We arrived at the VIP lounge to be greeted by the lovely Andrew, who proceeded to make me a coffee and my daughter a cold drink, gave us gifts and told us how the day would go. (Contrary to past reviews you can’t miss the lounge, big sign and red carpet gives it away). We managed to do every ride and were in the front row of every ride. We had plenty of photo ops, including a private session with the Madagascar characters. My daughter (21) even received a proposal from Puss in boots. We chose our lunch spot and Andrew found us a table and minded the bags while we got our lunch. The VIP lounge at Waterworld was heaven. My daughter was getting sunburnt so he got her an umbrella. Looked after our belongings while we were on rides, having photos and shopping. I can not praise us enough. My recommendation spend the dollars you won’t regret it.",Universal Studios Singapore

Loved the Autobots 3D ride & Water world show... actually they were all good. Would definitely recommend to buy an 'Express' pass before you enter as the normal wait time can be long. We got ours through Klook - see reviews as the ticket redemption booth is tricky to find & you have to redeem before you enter. I recommend to get there early & plan your day before as you can miss some shows or run out of time to go on rides. We decided to prioritise the rides over shows to get our moneys worth from the Express pass. Top get there we travelled by Cable car across seeing lots of Singapore sights from above.,Universal Studios Singapore
Cyprus,2.0,"November 25, 2019",Disappointed,"Maybe I am critical with this review because I have been to USJ several times, so it is natural for me to draw direct comparison let along drawing comparison with Disneylands.  First of all, I don't mind spending more money, if what offered to me is worth it, for example if I'm enjoying the park, I would definitely buy something to cherish my memory. But that wasn't the case, because the whole atmosphere didn't make me want to spend more.  - The park is small, the attractions are small and short - The decorations felt poorly made compared to other theme parks, so the atmosphere was lacking - Most staffs don't seem to bother to entertain the visitors, I mean they are helpful keeping people in order and in line, and that's it. In theme parks, I expect much more, or at least, they should be smiling and making us feel happy - Merchandises are limited and the quality didn't appeal to me. I am a huge Elmo fan, but there wasn't a Elmo merchandise I would like to add to my collection - Food wasn't good either  Since they marketed it as ""one-of-its-kind theme park in Asia"", it was very disappointing, because it is extremely far from the truth. There are countless better theme parks in Asia and I expect much much more when it comes to Universal Studios. I think Transformers was the only good memory I have from this visit.  Not sure if I want to visit USS again, since travelling to USJ is just as far for me.",Universal Studios Singapore

The Universal Studio is a nice place to visit for newcomers but if you had been to other theme parks like Universal Studios Los Angeles or Disneyland Hong Kong you would be disappointed. The park is small and hence the entire crowd is in queue for the ride. If you want to take all the rides buy the Express card else you would keep on waiting in the queue.

Sergi N,5.0,"November 22, 2019","Great themed park, amazing roller coasters!","Singapore is an inspiring city, full of culture and a role model on climate change combat. In Sentosa Island, we also find the ""themed"" part of the city/country and there the Universal Studios.  Wherever I go I always try to visit the theme park and this time I felt like I couldn't miss it. And it didn't disappoint!  The ticket is around 40 GBP and I would say that if you go in a weekday and non-holiday, you won't need a fast pass or anything else.  It is quite bigger than Disneyland Tokyo, although if you rush it through, you will have finished the main attractions by midday. You will even have time to ride the main ones several times.  What surprised me the most was the roller coaster ""Cylone"". I honestly wasn't expecting such an intense ride. I'm a fan of fast rides and so far the only ones that had me satisfied were in Port Aventura (Spain) but here, in Cylone, I found my favourite one.  For people that don't love rides so much, the theme is also really nice and there are shows and activities like movies or really soft.  Food is not that expensive considering that is a theme park and the whole park is really clean.  I loved it.",Universal Studios Singapore

SOH KIEN PENG,4.0,"November 21, 2019","Always refreshing, Always something new","Two years ago, I led a bus load of residents to this attraction for a fun and enjoyable night. This time I was tasked with the same assignment and I thought it would be very boring and monotonous to see the same old things again.  As in previous year, we booked the entire Universal Studio for our residents from 6 pm to 11.30 pm. It was school holiday and the response to the ticket sale was overwhelming. All 3000 tickets were completely sold despite the fact that they came here 2 years ago and despite the fact that the price of one admission ticket has increased from $20/- to $30/-.  About 70 buses were chartered to ferry the residents from the community center to the attraction. But the discounted ticket came with a price. It is just for a short few hours duration and few of the food outlets and play stations had closed.  The Madagascar A Crate Adventure was not open 2 years ago but this time we were lucky to jump into the boat rides and almost got ourselves wet by the raining water. The captivating and stunning water world performances appeared to me repetitive but I was attracted to a photo studio where you can choose to put on few of the Korean costumes on display and be photographed. It was fun attired in baggy and brightly colored Korean costumes with my bus `mistresses' in a superimposed beautiful Korean scenery in the background.  Unlike 2 years ago where I roamed in solo, this time I decided to walk around with my group of grassroots members. Knowing that the price of the food here is exorbitant, the 10 of us decided to combine all our individual food vouchers and bought for ourselves a big chicken pizza to share. It was a good idea and everyone enjoyed the `sumptuous' feat of pizza while we laughed and talked happily at the table.  Once stomach filled, we proceeded to have some fun with the ride at Sesame Street and watched a spectacular street hip hop dance near the corner. The pulsating music uplifted my spirit and I almost danced with them. I was attracted to the twirling and whirling Accelerator but a warning risk signage dampened my excitement. I felt regret not participating in the thrill. We wanted to try the Transformers but was discouraged by the 20 minutes queue.  We strolled around for a while and took some group photos with some of the cartoon characters before realizing that it was time to stand-by at the departing bus pick-up points for residents.  It was a short time spent but it was something different from the last time I came. The attraction seem small but there are many hidden treasures for you to explore. This time I felt happy to be in the company of my members as we explored the place. The last time I went on a solo rushing from one ride to another.  Enjoy as a group and treasure that social connection. There is always something refreshing something new in this wonderland.",Universal Studios Singapore
Billy,5.0,"November 20, 2019",Purchase ‘slip the queue’ tickets.,Really enjoyed Universal Studios Singapore. My only suggestion is to pay the extra $40 and get the ‘skip the queue’ tickets. It’s worth it!,Universal Studios Singapore
Tony P,4.0,"November 19, 2019",Great day out,"Been to Universal in the states & this may be smaller but still lots to do, very warm as you can imagine but loads of places to pop in that have great air conditioning, tickets quite pricey but not unexpected but worth a visit especially for the younger ones.",Universal Studios Singapore
Bruno The Vegan,4.0,"November 18, 2019","Sure, this attraction could kept up to date and fresh ???","We love this place and we have a season pass and we visit every month. A few points that I would like to see improved and updated: - vegan food options in general? Oasis Spice Cafe was friendly and good. - Can the fountain be repaired at Sci-Fi city? - Can New York's shopfronts be updated as some stuff has been sun damaged? Incorporate more movie elements. (there is a Gotham reference but Batman is Warner? No?) - Lights, camera, action: can the movie posters be updated please and give it a bit more sparkle. (at least give it a clean) - There is a minion shop but no minion attraction? Minion fountain doesn't work either - The lost world: great show! superb! 10/10! The decor is faded and props are poor. A few screens and a bit of sound goes a long way. - Far Far Away: a small detail: I was expecting the ''Welcome to Duloc animation'' like in the movie. Shrek 4D and Donkey Live was great. The enchanted airways: faded decor, could do with some screens and animation. Puss in boots: great ride but what's up with the story line? Again, faded decor. Madagascar: great decor and nice ride but could do with an animation upgrade. Revenge of the mummy: superb overall. What a great decor, entrance has great atmosphere. A few of the animations didn't work during the ride. Battlestar Galactica: Superb rides! But does anyone know actually the TV series? Is having a theme park not part of Universal Studios to promoted their franchises? Same with Jurassic Park rapid adventure: great ride but it needs updating as there are 5 movies in the franchise by now. Overall, this is a great theme park. It's not gigantic, it's easy to get to and easy to escape. And yes there is a bit of luck involved with the express pass but overal it's worth the extra money.",Universal Studios Singapore

The rides are fun, and with an express ticket (which is very expensive) I could jump the queues once for each ride. The transformers ride is something to experience! Same too for battlestar galactic, but some of the rides were lame, the food was beyond awful (and v expensive) and there was a severe lack of (working) fans or aircon at the ride queues, which to me is inexcusable. So was fun, but a mixed bag. The staff also seemed pretty clueless about what was going on for a large part of the time. Also note: getting out of Sentosa on an evening is a nightmare!",Universal Studios Singapore

Amelia N,4.0,"November 14, 2019",Fun time,"For public transport, take bus 123 which directly lead to below USS, and just an elevator up to the attraction, and return same bus 123 too. Its really cost efficient and no hassle. For USS ticket, express pass and go on non school holiday weekday is definitely what save us this trip from the infamous long queue. Make sure u check the performance and meet and greet session schedule and plan your day around it. Bring water bottles (many free water dispenser available) as drinks can be crazy expensive inside. Meet & greet session about 15min and there are plenty of place where u can take photo with the characters, love the staffs at photography section that helps us tk photo on phone in addition to their official photo, and they didn't charge us if we don't want the photo. Transformer is closed for servicing, which is one major downside for many I believed. The rest of the rides are alright. Enjoyed all the shows without much hassle and queue. I don't think there's need for unlimited express anyway.",Universal Studios Singapore

Connoisseur2012,3.0,"November 10, 2019",Worth a visit but expensive,"We visited universal studios in Singapore about 5 years ago. On this occasion their appeared to be no new attractions which was a little disappointing.  We also noticed that whilst on the previous visit there were plenty of film characters wondering around (Marilyn Monroe, Charlie Chaplin and Puss in Boots) available for photo opportunities, this time we only found someone in a red bird costume!  Only criticism was that whilst in the resorts design they have tried to make most attractions accessible to disabled people and the attraction staff try to assist then, as we left we noticed the staff at the gates making a guy with a walking stick walk to the far side of the entrance/exit gates rather than helping him by letting him out at the nearest gate.",Universal Studios Singapore

Rides were fantastic but long waiting, so we bought Fast pass for $70 and it was worth it. Made everything so much quicker. The longest wait we saw was 85 minutes. Food is pricy, as expected, but good. Rides that are definitely not to be missed are the Revenge of the Mummy, Cylon, Human and Transformers the Ride. We weren't able to get on the Transformers ride as there were repairs but we heard good things about it. Overall awesome Family friendly day out.",Universal Studios Singapore
Shailesh_Pathak,5.0,"November 9, 2019",Excellent place for wholesome family entertainment.,"Universal Studio does not need any review. it is a good facility for every type of person.

realnaget,1.0,"November 9, 2019",Disappointed by unscheduled closures (Express Pass pointless),"We arrived with our toddler yesterday excited to let him try all the junior coasters since he was above a 106cm already. We arrived around 11am which wasn’t too late - and decided to catch all the kids shows before doing all the rides. We started with Elmo at 1230, and some other outdoor shows like turntables etc; then Donkey Live, Waterworld. By the time we were done it was 4.  The only scheduled closure was for Transformers. We had saved our express pass UNLIMITED for Puss Inboots, Enchanted Airways etc; but made the mistake of going in Madagascar Crate adventure - whwre there was a technical issue . Since we had the express pass we were right in front of the ride and wasn’t sure if we should leave or stay. In the end the delay was AN HOUR! And by the time we were out it was a mad rush to finish the 2 other coasters Puss and Enchanted Airways. However for some reason Enchanfed Airways was closed!! No reason, nothing. We only managed one coaster before they already closed everything and didn’t allow us to queue for rides from 545pm onwards. This was even though the park was scheduled to close at 6pm. I bought the express pass unlimited for NOTHING.  Conclusion; express pass unlimited waste of money. Rides will close for no reason ; and today was all our toddler rides! We’re extremely disappointed by USS and likely will never go again with young kids.",Universal Studios Singapore
MissL219,4.0,"November 9, 2019",Fast passes are a must,"We bought the fast passes ahead of time as I had read that the queue times could be really long and it was definitely worthwhile. Some of the rides got up to 180 minute wait, especially for the Battlestar Galactica rides. There were a few other rides that were also very good. All of the rides had long waits in the end, so the fast pass is worth getting. We ate in one of the restaurants on site and it was a kind of self service way, but it still took a long time to queue to get food.",Universal Studios Singapore

When looking for the entrance of ""revenge of the mummy ride"", I didn't notice there was a photo-taking area where didn't have any sign or rails, and walked one step into the photo maybe. A female staff who was using her i-phone taking the photos screamed madly to stop me. Even around the noisy, her voice was so loud that made my ear hurting. I could have shouted back, but instead, I apologized and turned around. I didn't want to waste any time on it. But that made me very upset. Maybe, she thought she had been the servant of the Egyptian queen for too long so she had the right to shout to people? I hope not that stupid.  The facility is good. However, the experience is ruined by those undertrained staff.",Universal Studios Singapore
Jason526,5.0,"November 8, 2019",Great fun,"It was a great fun day out. Park itself I feel is smaller than I expected. I haven’t been to any other universal studios. One advice, make sure you get an express pass. One ride said 25 mins waiting time. We waited for 1 hour for it. After that we went to get the express pass. Such a lifesaver. We managed to get on all rides from the express pass. I don’t think we would be able to do that without an express pass. So many good food choices as well. Lockers are helpful too.

This time I was with my 8 year old grandson whose dream we were making possible. We bought tickets at children and seniors rates. We were in line before opening and security was strict with not allowing food inside the park. Big bags were checked. Bottles of mineral water were allowed but one can fill his water bottle from fountains around the park. Water wasn’t cold though and considering that it is always hot in Singapore, one is better off bringing ice cold water in their jugs. There are shows and attractions for young kids, teens and older people but Harry Potter is glaringly missing. But my grandson had the time of his life and the trip to Singapore was worth it. Food inside the park is expensive so we decided to eat dinner outside as soon as we were done.

He started taking rides like the Mummy, Human and Cylon. Rather troublesome as we needed to put everything in the locker before going up. If only they have little shelves like all the other rides, where riders can choose to place their bags nearby before riding and get them immediately after riding. We bought a day pass ticket to upgrade to season pass. The day pass in the past had a food voucher for $5, but now it’s retail voucher and a coke drink from any food court. Food voucher is preferred and the limitation of where the drinks can be purchased in slightly limiting and troublesome. Hope the drinks can be claimed fr any drink stall.

Anje,3.0,"November 5, 2019",Ruined the image by the rude staff,"What am trying to say is that “GUEST MUST BE TREATED WITH RESPECT” in any situation. The crowning failure was when a worker (should have taken her name)at the Far Far Away 4 D Shrek Animation slamming the 3D glasses when my sister asked her politely where to get the items. I was so shocked and enraged by her rude behaviour. There should be an announcement to the guests, get the 3D glasses before entering the so called “Torturing Dungeon”. We are not tortured by the dungeon but pissed off by the rudeness of the said staff. There was no proper ushered & direction. Guests bunched into the dungeon until announcement been made reminding to wear the 3D glasses for the show. The other scenario was guests are been hurrying in other words chased away when the meet and greet session has end its showtime. Definitely guests especially with children excited to take pictures of their favourite characters. But sadly they’ve been chased away unprofessionally. Is that how you treat your guests. To me these staff are not capable to work in amusement park industry. To work in a amusement park, you should be energetic, lively, cheerful and friendly to the guests. Not the other way round. In addition, the management of universal studios singapore should have a training session of their staff on how to improve a guests customers orientated satisfaction. The management should take seriously into the comfort of the guests while waiting and exhausted situation for the long queue at each park. Should have placed a giant mist fan, blowers and bench as your guests comprises a range of ages. Especially to the senior citizens and with small children. And also to look into how to resolve on the exhausted long queue issues. To create more lane perhaps or what not? Anyway, we had a great time enjoying the hyper realistic 3D thrill ride of the “Transformer”.",Universal Studios Singapore

Prigyan,5.0,"October 31, 2019",Was fun but A day is not enough,"Great place and has rides to cater to young kids 5+yrs and adults. For smaller kids I think shows and merry go rounds are there. we went on a weekday during Diwali time and still got a lot of crowd. Would highly recommend to invest in the express pass to make best use of time and cover all rides in case going to weekend or holidays especially with impatient kids. Constraints on some rides are based on height and dimensions and health.  Some tips: 1. One ride at Jurassic park is a wet ride, you can get drenched, so carry change of clothes or buy the transparent raincoats called ponchos for 5SD if you don’t like to walk around all wet. Noon time is pretty hot here so better to be wet at this time. Also shoes will get soaked so wear flip flops or remove shoes. 2. Don’t spend too much time clicking pics or buying souvenirs initially as you may not have time for rides. Also note it closes sharp at 6pm and you tend to be bit tired by 4-5pm after all the rides, best time to walk slow and take pics. Whole place can be covered well within half hr on foot. 3. At first hoping you are early, Walk around , check and prioritise those rides which you like the most and have smaller queues and wait times. 4. Some rides can have as long as 2hrs wait time like the galactica red and grey track and transformer so walk further from entrance and try and hit these rides first instead of going left to right along the circle which is what most of the crowd will be doing. Also most of the crowd will be clicking pics on entry so earlier the better to hit these rides. 5. The shows are at fixed times and not all shows are great. Research what you like and time the shows well ahead to ensure you don’t miss them. I liked the waterworld show, you can get wet here if you are in soak zone, would recommend to see the 12.15pm show. In the evening the entire crowd goes to see this amazing live stunt show with fire and guns and there will be no queues hopefully at the rides for a good 45mins which you can Utilise to your benefit. Take seats in this show as per your preference of getting wet or not. 6. For some rides you have to keep your bags in locker so travel as light as possible. 7. Carry hats umbrellas and sunglasses as place is very hot. At Roll-a-coaster like rides ensure you are not carrying or wearing at loose articles on you, like caps, mobiles, chains/necklaces, slippers etc. secure them well or remove them. Dress comfortably for the rides and hot weather. 8. Avoid rides which cause nausea immediately post lunch. Hit some shows or slow rides at this time. 9. Avoid lunch during peak times from 12 to 2pm, queues will less during this time, enjoy your rides instead. 10. Free Toilets are there. Also free drinking water is available at many points so carry your bottles. 11. The handlers of the rides are few and don’t rush in my opinion for ensuring all safety measures of the people on the rides are meet, so queues move a little slow. Also people having express pass get first priority and no wait time at all so another reason why queues move slow.",Universal Studios Singapore
Paw H,4.0,"October 31, 2019",Big boy again,"This a good experience- but quite expensive.  Transformers, the Egyptian temple and the roller coasters are great fun. It is a nice to go if you wanna be young and fearless again - for a day",Universal Studios Singapore

DJontheMove,4.0,"October 30, 2019",Late Entry without Express Pass - Updated Queue timing,"Been in Singapore for 5 years.. Never thought of visiting USS until today when i had some guest showed up from overseas.. After reading through all the 1 star comments, I decided to take Normal standard ticket via online without Express pass.  As a work pass holder i was able to buy it for $69 others on $75 rates.  We decided to visit today (30th Nov 2019 Wednesday). Not Weekend. Not Holiday season at least for local school or nearby counties.  Only risk was that we Singapore are notorious when it comes to rain. We started from North of Singapore it was already raining here. But fortunately Rain Gods favored us and moved the spell away from South and USS was safe.. None of the rides was cancelled. Rain in North gave us some good shade and cool breeze during the whole day.  Entry to USS.  - Got the Sentosa Express from VivoCity level 3. Payed $6 two way journey using MRT Card. - We arrived around 2:30pm lol. (Horribly late on purpose to avoid morning rush hour Q. We had bought tickets online) - Went straight to entry point, scanned email and got in. (they did not check bags for food or water) We had none anyways inside our backbag. - Entry Q time 0mins  1st Ride ""Madagascar A Crate Adventure"" - I was quite new to Roller coasters. so through we would start with something easy. - Reached the Ride around 2:36pm. Got Ride at 2:42pm - Waiting time: 6mins - Thrill Level:- Beginners - Ok for all kids - No Need for Locker facility. They let you carry small bags.  2nd Ride ""Enchanted Airways"" - Entered Queue around 3:08pm. Got ride around 3:26pm. Waiting time:18mins. - Thrill Level:- Ok for Beginners - Ok for Kids - i could see many kids on this ride :) - No Need for Locker facility. They let you carry small bags.  3rd Ride ""Shrek 4D Adventure"" - Please pass this if you do not have express pass as its a waste of time. But if you got kids with you, they would love it. If you are a thrill seeker, please pass this one without regret. - No Need for Locker facility. They let you carry small bags.  4th Ride ""Puss in Boots Giant Journey"" - Mini roller coaster ride. - Entry time 4:03pm, Got Ride 4:10pm Waiting time 07mins. - No Need for Locker facility. They let you carry small bags.  WATER WORLD TIMING (We missed it) - 12:15pm - 03:45pm  5th Attraction ""Lost World"" - You will get wet in this ride. But only your legs upto Knee. Some drops on your cloths. But you wont get socked. Trust me. I dont think this needs a locker as the sales guys in front of Q advertise. Just get a cover for your bag. Put all your wallet and phones inside it. you can carry the bag with you. - Entry Time: 4:30pm. Got Ride around 05:01pm - Waiting time around 30 to 40 mins.  6th Attraction ""Canopy Flyer"" - Entry Time 5:23pm got ride by 5:35pm - Waiting time around 12mins - NOTE:- Request for Front viewing seats. Else you will be seated in reverse direction of ride. ;) You are welcome.  Amber Rock Climb:- This is the moment when the lady at the service counter said, are you sure you want to do this? We are closing at 6:00pm WHATTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTT We still have int tried the main coaster.  We rushed towards Battle Star Galactica:- Got the ride around 5:45pm 5 mins waiting for Ride. AMAZING RIDE !!! Pricelses !!!  To End the day, late entry to Universal studio without express pass during non peak season, turned out to be ok. Q timing was min. If you are with company you wont know the time flying by. We missed couple of rides because of closure around 6:00pm. they had some corporate event taken over during evening. But again if we had come early we still would have to spend more time in Q. its a trade off.  Hope this has been informative to you. I will be back to enjoy the rest of the ride soon. ;)  oh by the way. food inside are priced $15 to $20 per person. you can just step out with reentry stamp and goto nearby 7/11 and get some awesome food for 3 people for $15 along with a drink. There are enough drinking pods near all rides.",Universal Studios Singapore
Shanqy,4.0,"October 30, 2019",Great place but not for the young once,"It has most of the rides the you can see in the US. But the park is a bit smaller. If you are with kids younger than 3 its not worth it, they wont be allowed to most rides. We went on a slow day, so we were able to get in to most rides within 20min, if you are going to buy the express pass, be aware that not all rides has express lanes.",Universal Studios Singapore
Tara,3.0,"October 30, 2019",Okay but not worth it,"We came here with pretty high hopes since we have been to Universal Studios every time we visit other countries. Unfortunately this one just didn't live up to the ones in Japan or California. It was a lot smaller and the amount of attractions for the younger crowds was just not worth the amount of money we spent. Even my nine year old wasnt impressed. The good thing about this place however is that the lines weren't too long and it incorporated Shrek, Madagascar and Sesame Street. The Shrek castle ride was by far one of our favorites and a must ride. Super cute 4D theatre type thing.  The staff appeared to not enjoy themselves at all. The only staff that was somewhat happy were the ones who did the shows.  Overall I would go back again if they added more rides and less paid activities.",Universal Studios Singapore

Niska C,3.0,"October 29, 2019",I GOT GOOD AND BAD EXPERIENCE TOGETHER,Rides r fun but need to queue for at least two hours to get ride(u can buy VIP pass). Better not to go during rainy season coz most of the rides and shows cancel for safety purpose when rain cloud coming.Don't go there weekends (super crowded)...weekdays tooo ;P (being a famous place i think it's understandable) If u want to enjoy the show... better check their show timing and plan where to go next if not u will miss the show Night time around eight u can enjoy fireworks display.,Universal Studios Singapore
Peter C,1.0,"October 28, 2019",Don’t bother !,"Very expensive waste of a day ! The queues even for the very basic rides were 2 hours which meant you were going to get on four rides maximum. I think you would have to purchase the fast passes which were double the admission price so would have been over $600 for my family of three, if you aren’t prepared to pay that then my advice is don’t go ! This was on a rainy day too so might get even worse than that, in fact they shut everything down for a while due to the threat of lightning, having queued for over two hours just to get on a flume this was the final straw so left, definitely wasted a day I think.",Universal Studios Singapore

bahiyahmj,4.0,"October 28, 2019",First Time Visiting a Theme Park as an Adult,"Based on the reviews here, I think a lot of you may already know what it is like. Before going into the park, I was prepared for what to do.  I came to the park early just as the gates started opening. I skipped some easy/less thrilling rides at the front and headed straight to the popular and thrilling rides. The waiting time was not as horrible only like 10-20 minutes. After settling those rides, only then I went to some easy-going ones.  Overall I would say that the rides there were pretty cool. There were a lot of drinking water fountains around. So it is pretty convenient and good to know that drinking water are easily found. There were lockers near rides that doesn't allow any items to be carried during the ride. So that's cool.",Universal Studios Singapore
alysiau2016,3.0,"October 27, 2019",Don't go if you don't want to wait.,I don't understand how they open the park at 10am and most of the rides/attractions aren't open until 11am so you have to fill in time going into the shops to stay out of the heat. The long queues were not good having to stand in the heat for only a short ride.,Universal Studios Singapore
Travelhoglet,2.0,"October 27, 2019",2 hour queues!!!,"Spent 6 hours in queues for 4 rides, in sweltering weather, 3 rides were closed for “maintenance” with no indication of how long it would take. We were so looking forward to all the rides, but our feet were killing us. Looks like long wait times are a common complaint, maybe Universal Studios should look at restricting the number of visitors?",Universal Studios Singapore
WHISKASyKANGOU,1.0,"October 27, 2019",Many rides closed and long queues,4 rides (the best) closed for technical reasons for long periods  1 hour long queues  Rides very short duration  Because of long waits had to oay to store small bangs in lockers  A waste of time and money,Universal Studios Singapore
Geoffrey W,4.0,"October 27, 2019",Typical American attraction.,Went to visit my son in Singapore and to see my granddaughter. Of course one the things she wanted to do with grandpa was to go to Universal Studios. It’s typical with the usual rides with an Asian tourist population. Before entering the into universal you must find your way through a maze of hotels and the casino. Not easy directions. At the end of the day my granddaughter loved it and so did grandpa,Universal Studios Singapore

RookieTales,5.0,"October 26, 2019",Great place to chill out,Visited this place for the first time and I love it! You need to put aside about 6 hours to complete the park which has various themes. I thoroughly enjoyed myself and will be back as I bought a Season pass on my first visit. My only grouse is that the park serves mediocre food at exorbitant prices. So bring your own water and food. The rides are great and screaming helps release all work stress! Highly recommended must visit place.,Universal Studios Singapore

Gabriella H,5.0,"October 25, 2019",Fantastic,"Fantastic day with our 3 teens. Bought tickets online to save time, only to discover we bought the residents ones by mistake. This was easily fixed at guest services and the cashier even took us through the gate to make sure all was ok. Great service :) We bought express passes and they were absolutely worth their price (cheaper online than at the park). Most we waited was 20min and that was because a ride had been closed briefly. Most were a 5min at most wait. We spent all day there and managed to go on almost every ride that had an express pass lane (midweek visit). Highlights - waterworld show. Just wow. Beware...splash zone is a soak zone. Spent quite a bit of time walking around soaking wet after that! Really amazing show, recommend!! Transformers 4D was outstanding and the single riders line moves as fast as the Express pass line. At the end of the day the lines were shorter so I did this one again as it was so good. Jurassic park whitewater ride was also excellent (got wet again!!). My adventurous teens also loved the BSG twin rollercoasters.  There are lots of water refill stations (usually near a bathroom).  A fabulous day to end our 2 week holiday in Asia!  The only negative was the extremely overpriced food - ours was not even hot (chicken!).  Otherwise, amazing!",Universal Studios Singapore
180kelly,5.0,"October 25, 2019",SUPER fun day!!!,"Had a great day - great for families, kids & adults. Get there for opening time at 10am as there’s lots to pack in the day. Get a VIP pass too as you spend your precious hours queuing instead of having fun. Crowds really died off after 4pm so waiting times were only a few minutes, but the park closes at 5pm. LOADS of places to eat but quite expensive e.g. $12 for a turkey leg, $4 for a can of Coke. LOADS of toilets and LOADS of water stations to fill up your water bottle. We got cheaper tickets off Klook.com",Universal Studios Singapore
Nico S,3.0,"October 24, 2019",Great day out,Had a fantastic day out at Universal Studios in Singapore. The Battlestar Galactica rollercoasters are by far the best rides at the park. Friendly staff and great attractions all round!!,Universal Studios Singapore
arsenalrulz18,1.0,"October 23, 2019",Really really bad theme Park,"What can i say? Really bad experience from the get go... The service culture is sorely lacking and please relook and retrain the staff that you hire- almost ALL are insipid and look like they are having the worse time of their lives. -At the entrance, we were holding a balloon ( my toddler was holding on to it , was from Mcdonalds), the staff gave us a gloomy face and went- Balloons not allowed- there was no offer to take it or help to dispose it for us etc... We have been to many theme parks around the world and the front line service staff do not deliver / convey messages in this manner...I respect the rules that we cannot bring a balloon in, but the way it was conveyed??! Next, we decided to take the Sesame Street Spagethhi Ride, this was on the 19th Oct 2019 morning , the staff at the entrance, I managed to get his name as he was wearing a tag ' BHIM' , also gave the most sour looking face, he got my son to take his height to make sure he could take the ride ( but yeah no smiles, no words at all....it was almost like he couldnt speak English, and when i asked him a question about the ride, he did not reply too )....PLEASE USS, hire staff that can understand or least speak English?! Lastly, we went for lunch at Discovery cafe and I witnessed a really rude staff member shouting at a old lady and her helper to ""MOVE""- no tact at all ....granted it was crowded, the message could have been delivered nicely?! In addition, the $13 chicken rice and fish soup was the nastiest food I've eaten... I doubt the park will have many repeat visitors....if the service culture continues like this....",Universal Studios Singapore
travellingcoeliacs,5.0,"October 23, 2019",Best day out on Sentosa,"With an 8 and 10 year old we had our first park experience where we were not limited by age, height or weight. It made for an easy and enjoyable day. While the park was not packed, some of the good rides had an hour long wait but we solved this with the universal pass. This meant no queuing and being able to go on our favourite rides as often as we wanted. It is pricey but we were on holiday and I would highly recommend it. Made for a fun and whinge free day. If you are gluten free. Take your own food. They checked our bags but when we told them it was gf food they let us take it in😁 Also take a water bottle as their are water refilling stations around the park.",Universal Studios Singapore
Hans H,5.0,"October 22, 2019",Certainly worth the visit,"Easily reached by skytrain, the park is well laid out and fairly compact. The Waterworld stuntshow is a must see.

GrandTour496993,5.0,"October 22, 2019",A must visit in Singapore,I went to Monday -weekday but it was so crowded with tourists. Most likely due to the float of tourist to Singapore rather than Hong Kong. I was using Klook and Wonderfly e ticket and scanned the barcode at entrance. With this tickets were way cheaper than on-site. You must purchase express pass in order to shorten the long queue especially bringing kids along. Long queue can be up to 45 min or till 2 hours! Park is way smaller than Osaka Universal but if you are in Singapore just go and pay a visit.,Universal Studios Singapore
Mac,5.0,"October 22, 2019",Universal Studios review,I visited Universal studios last year. This place is just awesome with lot of activities inside. Once you are here you will forget Disney land. The timings when we visited was from morning 9.30 - 10 till 10pm in the night. Also since we visited in December 2nd week there were Christmas decorations at various places in Singapore and also there was may events inside Universal studio. I would say a must visit place for anyone visiting Singapore.,Universal Studios Singapore
Janeane1965,5.0,"October 21, 2019",Incredible,May I say spend the extra money and buy the unlimited express pass. Definitely worth it so the entire day will cost you $160sg and worth every cent.

The Transformers Ride, Steven Spielberg Show, Shrek Show, Mummy Ride, Rapids Adventure, and Jurassic World Show are a must visit. You can take the rides you like multiple times. The timings are 10 am to 6 pm. It is recommended to reach this place before 10 am so that you can complete everything. Take the standard ticket and avoid the Express Pass. This takes one full day and is a bit tiring. Ensure that you are not arriving or departing Singapore on this day.",Universal Studios Singapore

Sara C,4.0,"October 19, 2019",Wonderful day + Take with you list,"We arrived in Singapore on Sunday, bought the tickets for the Universal studios (there was a little discount) and the Garden by the Bay at the airport (there was a kiosk next to the the exit) , together with the local public transportation pass (26$ for three days that you can top up on 4th day) . Very convenient so that we didn't have to queue at the attractions which were always crowded. You can buy them also online but I'm not sure if you have reductions. We visited Universal Studios on Monday and it was a good choice as it rained just when we were about to leave the park at 6pm. Even if expensive we bought the unlimited fast pass inside the park at a shop near the entrance (80 $ not fixed price as changes every day) so we could access all the attractions. Probably the one time fast pass could have been enough for us (cheaper than the unlimited, 50$ on that day). We took a map and day's events list and decided what we didn't want to miss : the Sesame Trick or Treat show (20 minutes) was really appreciated by the 8 years old boy, and the hip-hop street dancers not far away from the first exhibition. Everything was so exciting. The place gets pretty busy during the day so it's better to enter at 10am so that you can enjoy it fully.  Recommended items to take with you : - a bottle to refill at the water fountains - hat because the sun can be strong - sunscreen lotion - rain poncho for some attractions - a plastic bag for placing your shoes for water games - umbrella - clothes change just in case - paracetamol (changing from hot to air con places easily turns in headaches.)

shawnabrooks,4.0,"October 19, 2019",Fun for the family,"Went on a Wednesday still pretty busy but worth it. Cost $79 for one adult. Only open from 10am to 6 pm. It's unfortunate it doesn't open later because it would be nice to go when its cooler outside. In the early afternoon the popular rides (puss and boots, canopy flyover) etc had a 60 min wait.

I thought it was just a simple and enjoyable ride in a tomb but I didn't see the thrill coming!

Kareen,5.0,"October 13, 2019",Lots of fun!,Heading to Sentosa Island is an awesome day. We did universal studios as the first part of our day on the island and easily saw all of the attractions by early afternoon. The rides were fun and the park is well planned out. The underwater world show was pretty epic - sit in the splash zone to cool off from the humid heat! There are lots of restaurants in the precinct outside the park gates for before/after too.,Universal Studios Singapore
Kaleighpot,4.0,"October 12, 2019",Fun!,It's really fun in here more for bigger kids. It's so fun to see your favorite movie characters in real life and have your picture taken. But it gets sooo hot though so bring a lot of cold water. Queue also gets so long sometimes you have to queue for more than an hour. So if you can afford it splurge for the express pass.,Universal Studios Singapore
Md Alamgir Hossain,5.0,"October 12, 2019",Fanatic enjoyment,The place of enjoyment. You need whole day to visit the place even you cannot finish. Full of charms with a definite zone. All the things are exciting n excellent. Hope nobody should come back without visiting the place.,Universal Studios Singapore

Food-Crusher009,5.0,"October 12, 2019",Truly Magical & Memorable,"We were on our first visit to Universal Studios - Singapore last August and it was truly magical and stunning. We spent almost a full day in the universal studios. One of the most clean, warm and organized place we have visited in the recent time and all the staff were warm, helpful and fun loving. If you really wanna go back in your childhood then please visit this place before you die.... ancient Egypt, Jurassic Park theme park, roller coaster rides, RT dance shows, transformer shows and many more.... worth spending every single dollar inside the studio, meeting with different cartoon character will allow you to go back to your childhood and act as a 10 year old kid - the whole atmosphere made us kid for few hours. At times you feel that the place is overcrowded but still worth it. Go if you have time like full day if you are planning to visit for only two to three hours then you might won’t enjoy. So overall we had a wonderful time - which we will not be forget - it’s a lifetime souvenir... we will visit again next year...",Universal Studios Singapore
Simone Andrea,5.0,"October 12, 2019",Fantastic day out with the express pass,"We visited this week on Wednesday, expecting fewer crowds mid week. Arrived just before 10.00am and there was a massive crowd already lining up at the entrance.  Bought the express pass and managed to cover just about everything my teenage son wanted to do by 3.30pm. The shows were excellent and great interactive fun. This was his favourite day out in Singapore.  Would recommend spending a day here, but only with the express pass to save precious time in the queue.",Universal Studios Singapore
NZonetreehill,5.0,"October 12, 2019",Great Day Out,"A great day out for the family. Arrive early ( 20mins before gates open). This lets you get a few of the bigger rides out of the way with no ques. Ques were max of 30 mins if you timed it right. No need to buy an express card at this time of the year, even on a Sat. The water world show and ‘lights, camera action’ shows were a highlight. My husband and son also recommend the Transformers . We caught a taxi from Bugis and this cost only about $14. You can get a hand stamp and eat outside for cheaper and go back in. Over all, well worth the money.",Universal Studios Singapore
Chenghong,1.0,"October 12, 2019",Wasted Day Out!,"I am a Singaporean and I am concerned on writing a bad review for USS. It’s my 4th or 5th visit to USS, and all previous visits are good, but I can’t help but feel that their focus on bringing smiles have gone off track over the years... Hope this review will give make the management team rethink their strategies.  My recent visit is horrible, 5 hours and just 1 ride + badly over priced food. Totally spoiled my 5 year anniversary with my wife.  Day started at 10am, observed an argument at the gates between USS staff and a group of tourists. It might be the issue with the group of tourists, but the way things were handled by USS staffs is disappointing. Huge crowds of queue resulted from the saga and unhappiness can be observed even on by standers.  Since it’s not our first time in USS, we went straight to the biggest ride. Aimed for the Human ride as it says 15mins wait. Ended the wait was 35mins before I first catch a glimpse of the ride. As unlucky as it can be, the ride faced technical problems at this moment. And it took next 20mins of troubleshooting before they announce there is an issue. I pity the people in the queue behind me, as they are in the queue without any information. Since We are right at the front of the queue, we decided to hold on, and luckily the ride resumed after 15mins. I have to say the USS employees did not handle the situation at all, and not the least apologetic. I don’t expect them to bow like the Japanese, but no communication and simply ignoring the crowd wouldn’t make things better. It is almost like the breakdown has nothing to do with them. Ofcourse they didn’t cause it, but they don’t feel the ownership of the USS brand in their work at all.  Next, we went for lunch. The steak place we planned to go was closed for private event, after we walk so far to reach it. It’s just our bad luck, but it could have helped if such info was provided on the web or near the entrance. Moving on, we ate SGD13 chicken rice and SGD5 coke each... totally unsatisfying and overpriced... this may be the norm, but I can’t help to be pissed...  After lunch, we went straight to the mummy ride, again 15mins wait posted at the entrance. Went in, only see the ride after 40mins. Dejavu.... the ride is down... and waited another 30mins before they announced the breakdown... (see image for photo of tired waiting people) this time, I didn’t wait just left the place. I hate to think that I took a day off from work and paid almost SGD160 just for all these service. Got out and faced another challenge at the locker area, as people crowd around the lockers demanding the locker attendant to unlock. Note: free locker is only first 45mins, any longer you are charged. People are squeezing in and for locking and unlocking stuffs, and it is Chaos!!! 1 old man trying to unlock lockers one by one, other USS staffs passing by just said they can’t help, need to wait for the old man. They sure have the attitude of this isn’t my problem. The same thing happened in my first ride, but at the mummy area is way more chaotic due to small space. Not to mention, we noticed that the entrance USS staffs don’t even know the ride is broken, and they allow more riders to enter to queue.  That was it, and we went straight to guest service to demand my money back. It was successful, but not until we have to hear the staff preaching about how the rides breakdown is not within their control and we can go for other rides. I lost my anger a little and told the staff that breakdowns can be under control via proper maintenance (I run a production plant, and equipment management is not new to me).  Finally after 5 hours, we got out of USS having just taken 1 ride and ate some lousy and expensive lunch. Fortunately, Vivo City Mall redeemed the day, else our anniversary will end in the worse way possible.",Universal Studios Singapore
Ajay Kacker,5.0,"October 11, 2019",Absolutely the must see place in Sentosa,"One day is not enough to see everything in this wonderful place.  Entry is through the Resort World station on Sentosa express station.  Themed enclosures on Puss in Boots, Egypt, Waterworld, Jurassic Park, Lost Kingdom, Shrek, New York, Space Galactica are present, which are unique in their own ways.  Each themed enclosure would have a unique ride in terms of water sport or roller coaster along with a 4 D show and live performances.  The space roller coaster and the Egyptian roller coaster are not for the faint hearted.  The 4D movie on Shrek is good and the Waterworld live performance is simply Hollywood.  Enough picture opportunities and food outlets and curio ships ensure that time is well spent.  However flip side is that one is unable to see everything in one outing as huge queues dominate proceedings.  Leave from home early and carry rain capes or bur one at 5 dollars from Universal studio.  Simply outstanding",Universal Studios Singapore
jetset8888,1.0,"October 11, 2019",Horrible experience,"I recently visited universal studio with my 5 year old daughter.  Unfortunately this was during golden week and this meant it was busy with mainland tourists.  This aside the we arrived at 10:30 the wait time for rides and attractions was terrible, I paid another 130 Singapore dollars to get an express pass, 50mims later having used it for one ride dark clouds came over with very light rain.  You guessed it all rides stopped. So all the restaurants where packed too 35min plus wait time. We decided to leave.  On the way put I went to customer service desk to speak to someone and give them feedback and was told no refunds on the express pass nothing to appease the feeling of a wasted day.  There care factor was zero shameful service. I wrote a customer feedback form 7 days later nothing herd from them.  Arrived at 10:30 left at 2pm we got to go 4 rides and didn’t eat either as 35mins to wait for average food tipped us over the edge.  Please avoid this place and save your money.",Universal Studios Singapore

Marty3350,4.0,"October 10, 2019",Everything you would expect,"This is a great theme park. It offers something for all ages. The rides are awesome. The only negatives I would share are that quesues for rides became rediculous (up to 80min). This can be avoided by purchasing an express pass (approx $70), however, this makes for a very expensive day out. They also know that they have a captive audience, reflective in food and beverage prices.",Universal Studios Singapore

franckydoudou,5.0,"October 10, 2019",awesome for 1 day,it is not as big than the one in USA Florida and some stuff is missing (like Harry Potter or the Simpsons) but overall it is a very nice Park with lots to do during a day. we took the fast pass ticket (for 1 entrance for every ride) and it was worth it even if the day was not so crowded (weekday). do not expect to eat so well there it lacks some good restaurants. do not miss Transformers and the Mummy (not for every one as can be scary for young crowd or pepole who dont like darkness and horror houses).,Universal Studios Singapore

Tamara T,4.0,"October 9, 2019",Great day,"This is a great theme park - small enough to easily get around in one day and big enough to offer a lot of variety. I recommend doing some research based on what time of the year and day of the week you are going; it is possible to do all the good rides in a reasonable timeframe without forking out for the express pass but you do need to be smart about it. The picks for me were Revenge of the Mummy and Transformers. Transformers in particular was unlike any ride I've ever been on and I was surprised how much I enjoyed it. Just a tip - it's Singapore so it's always hot, but there are parts of the park (primarily Sci-Fi and Egypt areas) that have a lot of concrete and not much in the way of foliage so the heat reflects off the grounds and gets really warm.",Universal Studios Singapore
ABP - Indonesia,2.0,"October 9, 2019",Not so good,All rides are closing before 7PM. USS shall at least extend its operating hours. 10AM to 7PM is not worth for the money you paid. Should be at least 10PM.,Universal Studios Singapore

Bhavik Kiri,5.0,"October 8, 2019",Amazing Experience,This is one of the must do things when you are ar Sentosa and you would surely not be disappointed at all.  Based on our experience here are some tips  - Please ensure you go there on weekdays as much as possible as it tends to get crowded on Weekends & Public Holidays - Take a 2 day pass cause one day might not be enough for it - Take the express pass if you are planning to cover it in 1 day  Rides on th normal pass can soemtimes take a lot of time based on the rush.  Other than that just an amazing place to visit,Universal Studios Singapore

It's hot just like it is in Florida and the food is overpriced but the souvenirs are very reasonable.

Sallie,4.0,"October 8, 2019",A big day out,"On the list of my 15 and 12 year old to visit, along with our 9yo we spent a the whole day in the park. Arriving 9:30 - half hour before park opened we waited in the line for gates to open with some other pushy tourists ( we are from Australia). We made our way around each world trying out the rides as we go. Some lines were no problems 10 minute wait. Others over an hour. Now we could have purchased a fast pass and if it was not going to cost us an extra $350 for all of us we probably would have. Watch other bypass our waiting was frustrating for the kids and some ride operators allowed 1 for 1 but other just let through the fast pass guests. All rides good and there were plenty for all of us to enjoy. The water world stunt show was very entertaining and we all enjoyed it and if you want to get wet sit front and centre! A few things that were frustrating where a few of the rides required no bags / hats phones etc.. meaning you had no choice but have 1 person sit off or hire a locker. There was an okay range of food in the park to choose from but as per normal it is a bit more expensive. Plenty of shops to buy merchandise from and at the 6 oclock mark when you are being bearded out of the park the shops are nuts. There is are a heap of food outlets out side the park to have dinner at as well. Overall even though it rained for most of the day it was a great day out!",Universal Studios Singapore

Vamsidhar K,5.0,"October 7, 2019","No Pain , no Gain",One of the finest studios designed for entertainment alone. The major attraction here is the roller coaster. Anyone can get all information from the net. But the major setback here is the huge influx of people that flock everyday to visit this Marvel. My advice: please make sure to buy express passes in advance online. The only way where one can complete at least 50% of the entire shows is only by way of express passes. Without these the only thing that anyone can do is to keep photos and come back.,Universal Studios Singapore

If you’re an adrenaline junkie like myself, be sure to head over to the battlestar galactica: human vs cylon roller coasters! (Personal fav.. cylon) you won’t be disappointed. There are plenty of rides to experience, places to dine and shops to spend money in. Be sure to catch the show at Water World, it’s like no other. Take photos with as many characters as you like as its free! It was really great to see a theme park not charging for character photos for once. Transport off Sentosa was a breeze, just jump on the monorail. Highly recommend for tourists travelling with young ones as there is plenty for them to do!

Cassandra B,5.0,"October 6, 2019",Such a fun day out!,"Visited with a friend! We had such a fun day out and enjoyed it all! We got there early and made a game plan to more one way around the park and do the loop around. My recommendation would be to get the fast pass as we did spend a lot of time waiting in lines for rides, or if you’re happy to not sit together on rides then they have single rider lines on some rides that are used to fill seats on rides which lines can move faster. Allow yourself a full day to get around the park, take a backpack or easy bag to carry, lockers are available. Be sure to wear sun cream and a hat as it can get hot out in the sun all day.

Hillary K,3.0,"October 4, 2019",Alright for a day out but rides are very short and entertainment is not as varied as in the US parks.,"Purchased general admission for myself and two teenage children. Attraction wait times were low and we actually found that most rides, even big name rides like Transformers, only had a 5-10min wait if you were willing to use the app and come back to rides throughout the day. Except thw two rollercoasters where we waited 30min and 45min respectively.  That said, this park just doesn't compare to the Florida and California counterparts...we didn't encounter any random park entertainment wheras usually you will find some music or comedy or crowd entertainment in the US parks. Even the two shows we qued for ended up being cancelled due to weather...so a bit dissapointing given that really rain is a common nearly daily occurance in Singapore.  The attractions would be good for smaller children as most are short and safe and slow...we found the park a bit short of thrill rides.  Know- This is a small theme park with only about 20 or so attractions. We were there for six hours and had circled the park three times.  If you're looking for a fun and easy day out in Singpore after having already visited Singapore's other amazing attractions (zoo, gardens, etc..) and you're willing to pay the price tag give it a go...otherwise really its not a must see!",Universal Studios Singapore
Fidsy,3.0,"October 4, 2019",Don’t bother without express passes,11yo and 13yo very excited heading to Universal Studios for the day. Entered at 1030 and went straight to line up at Cylon which had ‘25min wait’ when we entered. We eventually got to almost the front after 1.5hrs. The express lane has total priority and it wasn’t unusual for 4-5 full rides of Express people to go before anyone else in the normal line. Then there was ‘inclement weather conditions’. Which put a total halt on all outdoor rides. So after 2 hrs still waiting in line we decided to leave.  Universal studios needs to balance both express passes and normal admission riders similarly.,Universal Studios Singapore

Tried getting photos with meet and greet characters with the kids - these queues were extremely long too and often cut off before we could even get in the line !! What a disappointing day it was.

PumpkinDQ,3.0,"October 4, 2019",Such a disappointing experience,"I love  theme parks with my family and we visit the Universal Studios Singapore almost every 2 years.  We were there yesterday and over-all experience really deteriorated big-time from our visit last 2017. The park was full therefore waiting time for rides were long and quite disorganized.  For the Mummy Ride for example,  they used the ""Single Rider"" queue for Express Pass holders without additional signages, so some Single Riders who queued have to head to the exit and queue again (what an inconvenience) furthermore,  after queuing for 30 minutes they closed the ride.  I believe some unforseen breakdown might occur however they can look onto more stringent preventive maintenance so as not to affect their patrons.  Another very disappointing experience - the photo-taking with the characters (statues) of Madagascar,  Sesame Street,  etc.  I appreciate they have the ropes for orderly queues,  they have official photographers stationed but they didn't allow us to take photos with our own cameras or handphones.  They anyhow took photos using our phones with a maximum of 2 shots ONLY.  It's like forcing us to buy the photos they took.  This was not the system previously and besides,  we paid for the entrance to the park which includes all the attractions and photo spots.  So why will they prohibit photo taking? It's such a disappointment. I submitted this review not to discourage people to visit USS but to get my message across the management and clamour for improvements.",Universal Studios Singapore
Swapna,1.0,"October 4, 2019",Worst experience,We went to Universal on 4th Oct 2019 and had the worst experience ever. Far too many people the park can accommodate. Each place waiting for at least 2 to 2.5 hrs. We could only take 3 rides. Getting in itself took us 45 minutes. With so many people it a serious violation of safety and security. Kids cried out of suffocation and tiredness in tight lanes.  Too much greed and selfish state of affairs. Sadly no one seem to regulate the number of people allowed at the park and sadly Singapore govt is not keeping a watch of it.,Universal Studios Singapore

eeyoreBrisbane,5.0,"October 4, 2019",A great day,We spent a day here. Had a great time. Tickets are available on line or at the entrance. Crowd was reasonable the day we visited. We were able to go on most rides even with some of the day raining. Food is theme park prices. Starbucks on Main Street was good. If you go on the Jurassic Park ride be warned you will get wet. Use a poncho if you don’t want to get too wet. Lockers are available next to some rides for no cost for short amount of time. Check out the map before going. Lots of restaurants and food options just outside the park. There is only one merchandise shop outside of the park and it’s small so buy inside the park. Halloween horror nights are a great event if you are visiting at this time of year.,Universal Studios Singapore
Adrian,5.0,"October 4, 2019",An excellent day out,"You're in Singapore, now what? There's a wealth of adventure spots on this small island. Universal Studios is a must for family and friends of all ages. Great rides to go on and some a little more for the thrill seekers amongst us. Make a day of it. It makes for a great memories for your visit to Singapore.",Universal Studios Singapore
Max,5.0,"October 3, 2019","Excited, fast",I bought the one time express and tickets online. Most of programs take less than 30 minutes to wait by using express pass. The roller coaster is excited which include 2 type(BSH and BSC). There is enough time to finish all programs with express.,Universal Studios Singapore
Sue Skitterall,5.0,"October 3, 2019",Friends on vacation,While visiting Singapore we were lucky enough to go to Universal Studios. We went on most of the amazing rides.plenty to see a do to keep you there for the whole day.Lots of eateries and drink stands. Jurassic Park was a favorite ride.we had a great time.,Universal Studios Singapore
Belinda R,2.0,"October 3, 2019",Do not bother!! They are only interested in making money NOT customer experience. Long Waits even with Express Pass,"Paid $850 for 3A 1C entry with Unlimited express passes. Universal Studios, we love theme parks and have been to many and have purchased express passes at those that we could. We have also been to the major attractions in Singapore over the last 6 days. I would never recommend this theme park to anyone. It was unbearable waiting with the express passes, I can only imaging how awful the waiting was for those who didn't have them. Plus an. Hour wait to get through a short line at Friars for food, ridiculous! The express pass is not worth the expense and the park is not worth it without the pass. Limit the express passes further and limit the amount of visitors per day. Either that or provide more rides and entertainment. Quality over quantity. To anyone reading this review- Gardens By the Bay is amazing, The S.E.A Aquarium was absolutely stunning, the 4 park hopper pass- Zoo, night safari, bird park and river safari- worth every cent, spend your money elsewhere!",Universal Studios Singapore
Anniewhatto,5.0,"October 3, 2019",Fun to Visit,"My husband & I went here & really enjoyed our day, it did rain whilst we were there but still able to see & ride just about everything, make sure to do the 2 big Roller Coasters ‘Battle Star Galactica’s Human & Colon’ first, we enjoyed all the shows, a good day out.",Universal Studios Singapore
Adventurer297617,5.0,"October 3, 2019",Great day out,A great day out. We had two adults and 12 & 8 year old. Paid for the express pass and it was well worth it. We definitely would not have managed to go on all the rides we wanted to without it. Nice to find air conditioned spaces to eat and refill the water bottles. A great variety of rides and entertainment.,Universal Studios Singapore
ajklm72,5.0,"October 2, 2019",So much fun!,As a family of 4 with two teenagers we had the best day! Luckily we visited universal during the week as I'd hate to see how busy the weekend would be. Waiting approx 20-30 min for each ride was painful and highly recommend paying a little extra for express to save time. Food & toilet access was easy. Overall an AMAZING experience!,Universal Studios Singapore
Nikki G,3.0,"October 1, 2019","Great time overall, but check out the advice first","We visited Universal Studios Singapore on 1/10/19. We bought standard entry as part of a multi-ticket deal. Having been to Universal in Orlando and LA previously, this does not compare. It’s smaller, MUCH more expensive and pretty poorly organized/run.  We followed advice on here to the letter- visited on a Tuesday (mid week) in off season (Aussie Oct school hols). Arrived at 9am and queued early. Went straight to Transformers (no queue), followed by Cylon and Human (no queue), then to the Mummy- so we got all the big ones out the way early. Spent afternoon doing rapids, Dinosaur boat ride and the shows. Only bought kids Shrek pancakes and ice-cream ($15sg each) as food and drinks were SO expensive. Cups with a plastic dinosaur stuck on top were $25sg each!!! We made the most of the day and my boys aged 8 & 9 enjoyed it. Both left with some overpriced merchandise (transformer toys were 3x the cost you can buy them for at Target).  We had a good day overall as both boys were old enough to go on everything but young enough to be amused. I’d imagine there’s not really enough there to keep older kids amused for a day and I don’t think we will need to visit again.",Universal Studios Singapore
Donna A,4.0,"October 1, 2019",Great day out,"My husband and I visited here. It was our first time at a theme park without children. And we had a ball. Went on all the rides. Bought themed merchandise. Got photos with characters. It seems as soon as you walk in the gates, your inner child comes out to play. The roller coasters were great. We didn’t buy a fast pass, and didn’t have to wait too long at most rides. There is a good variety of rides available, suitable for all ages. Had a great day.",Universal Studios Singapore
arvinaer,5.0,"September 30, 2019",Awesome Themepark,"As much as we want to try all the rides at Universal Studio Singapore, we could not because of the long queuing line. We could only afford only the Adult pass. But the experience was great. Try the transformers ride first just to give you that adrenaline for all the other rides. I don't recommend the Puss in Boots rides, the feeling is like ahhh..ow..ahhh..ow..ahhh..ow.. It's good for the kids though.",Universal Studios Singapore
Kesh,2.0,"September 30, 2019",No discounts for wheelchair users. Disappointing,I enquired for special discount as I'm whcr bound and am unable to walk at all but was told to pay adult price $79. I asked if they were willing to gv me the seniors price because I know I won't be able to take any ride..unfortunately they were adamant n insisted in me paying the full price. I had no choice but to pay as my son was with me. I didnt go on any of the rides. Really disappointing for a country like Singapore who has made life of whcr users so friendly with their amenities and pathways.. But they somehow forgot in this aspect. USS should look into this matter and not make us disabled ppl feel so rejected. I spent all my time sitting under the sun while waiting for my son to finish his rides.. And that's what I get for paying $79..? A real rip off or shall I say daylight robbery. USS should find a new way to tackle this matter.. If u all find that this can be misused then pls ask us to produce our special needs cards.. I'm sure most countries have this cards. I do posses a special card for my physical disability but unfortunately USS didn't was not interested. I hope USS gets to the bottom of this and answers me. Thank you,Universal Studios Singapore
hsbaek1209,5.0,"September 30, 2019",Wow amazing,"Galacia atlantica, the roller coaster was very exciting and fun. And thenroller coaster in eazypt session was really tricky and fun.

Xen_Paul,1.0,"September 30, 2019",There has to be a discount for weather,I understand businesses need to survive but when the entire theme park is rained out surely some redress could be offered. Our day was utterly brought to a standstill because of a tropical downpour which lasted hours. And all the rides (understandably) stopped. This was our family trip completely ruined - in a very expensive way too!,Universal Studios Singapore

Awesome guy!!  Overall super fun place, definitely recommend!",Universal Studios Singapore
claireandryan3,3.0,"September 29, 2019",Overrated and overpriced,Overall a bit average and not good value for money. Queues were excessively long with numerous “expected wait times” of 45 or 60 minutes. Had expectations of seeing characters and stars throughout the day but these were very few and for limited times only. On 3 separate occasions we were told “line closed” so couldn’t meet the characters and get photos. Got a photo taken with a transformer and paid $35.,Universal Studios Singapore

Nani Didi,5.0,"September 29, 2019",Visit in low season,"Kids are loving it. We were so lucky visiting during low season and weekday. We did the ride several times and did almost all of them with almost new queue at all. I cannot imagine being here in high season, probably I would hate it. If you have the luxury of time, visit low season otherwise prepare to queue for at least 2 hours per ride which only runs for 3 mins.",Universal Studios Singapore

btreid,5.0,"September 27, 2019",Excellent theme park,"If you are in Singapore and you like theme park, this one who should be on your top list. You will not be disappointed. We've been in Universal Studios Hollywood and Universal Studios Orlando and both are excellent as well. I like this one better of all because the attractions are NOT far from each other. The Water World is literally next to Jurrasic Park ride! And the Mummy Ride is next to the Transformers. And the Shrek Castle attraction should not be missed. We went on a Wednesday and no long queues. Only Jurrasic Park had the longest wait , about 45 minutes. Other rides, 10mins or less. Everything is expensive inside the park. So, if you are on a budget make sure all your kids are fed and you have plenty of water in your backpacks. Yes, it's small theme park but sure a quality theme park Highly recommended for families.",Universal Studios Singapore
Geoff H,5.0,"September 27, 2019",Great fun,Every year is great. There were small variations this year but always good. Maybe a few ride upgrades would help improve our return visits.,Universal Studios Singapore
Lucelyn Calizo,5.0,"September 27, 2019",Awesome Theme Park,An Awesome Theme Park. All worth it despite of the long line. I love The Revenge of the Mummy and the Transformers rides.,Universal Studios Singapore
Emma,4.0,"September 26, 2019",Worth it if planned well,"We arrived at about 9.15 and had to convert our booking confirmation into a ticket at guest services (hard to find as the ticket booths are set out in front, blocking it). We were in the queue by half 9 and they started letting people in by about 10 to 10. We headed straight for Cylon and only had to wait 5 minutes then went to Human and had about a 10 minute wait. Cylon is much more of a ‘thrill ride’ than Human. Mummy was then only about a 15 minute wait. Definitely worth getting there early! When we got off Mummy it still said 15 mins so we decided to do it again. However it ended up being much longer and we therefore were charged for having our belongings in the locker for over 45 minutes. It wouldn’t open our locker until we’d paid yet obviously all of our money/cards were inside the locker as you weren’t allowed anything on you! Took ages to find a member of staff and we were charged $4 even though the queue time was wrong..: ridiculous system. The lockers for human/Cylon seemed to be more up to date and the time you were allowed changed based on queue times - much better system. The queues after this were longer, longest wait was about an hour. Do single rider where you can. We did for canopy flyer and Jurassic park and we ended up going very close together so didn’t have to wait around for each other. This meant we queued for about 10-15 minutes for Jurassic park rather than 110. It want obvious that there was a single rider queue so make sure to ask. We kept checking Cylon throughout the day (on the app as well as at the ride - not always completely accurate but better than nothing) and were waiting for it to reduce. At 6.45 it said only 30 mins and we thought we might even be able to do another ride after before the park shut at 8. However it took over an hour. Think they had a problem with the ride and by the time we got there they only had 1 running rather than 2. However in the time we queued, those with express passes got on the ride about 3 times! Seeing as an express pass would’ve cost us $110 each (even buying in advance), it is unfair that they get so much priority. Overall we did 14 rides/shows in the day which we were happy with but I agree with many other comments that express pass holders get too much of a priority.",Universal Studios Singapore
Megan McDonald,5.0,"September 26, 2019",The place is awesome and full of entertainment...,"Amazing experience. The best rides are the two main roller coasters Battlestar Galactica, do those first as they are the most awesome rides in the park. Next go for the transformers, revenge of the mummy, Jurassic park rapid adventures, Shrek 4d. There is a cool show at the water word section too. You have to place bags in locker for certain rides. So think about that if your bags are huge. There are cafes and merchandise shops all over the park as well as portable wate.",Universal Studios Singapore
Duncan Y,4.0,"September 26, 2019",Good place to spend an entire day,We've been to the one LA back in 2012 and Singapore was very similar with new additions. We enjoyed it and there are a few rides for young children. We had a great time will return.,Universal Studios Singapore
Chris M,2.0,"September 25, 2019",Poor attempt at a park,Having been to ma y theme parks thorough the world I have to say this park is a major disappointment.  Even before you get to the park the experience is poorly managed with a monorail system to a park which had the majority of rides either closed or broken.  Wouldn't go back and really wouldn't reccomend it in comparison to the American parks.,Universal Studios Singapore
mhsiong,3.0,"September 25, 2019",Smaller than I thought!,"This place is small and the duration of the rides are shorter compared to the ones in Japan or USA. Dependant on how long you plan to stay in Singapore, if you only have 1 full day to spend on Sentosa Island, then it is advisable to get the Express Pass. That way you get to take all the rides available and still finish by lunch time and that way, after lunch you can get to explore the rest of the island's attractions!",Universal Studios Singapore

Abdul Rauf,4.0,"September 24, 2019",Worth visiting but waiting times are huge,This theme park is smaller in comparison to the one in Paris. This results in huge waiting time for the rides like Transformers 3D Ride and Jurassic Park Rapids Adventure. Had to stand in queue for around two hours for each one. So only two rides in 4 hours. Its frustrating and tiring. Otherwise the attraction is worth visiting.,Universal Studios Singapore

Grant B,4.0,"September 22, 2019",A fun theme park on Sentosa Island.,"This Universal Studios theme park is not as big as the ones in America, but still has a lot of interesting features and thrilling rides. Unlike the original Universal Studios in Hollywood, California, there's is no tram ride through the back lot. It does have some of the popular rides from the other theme parks such as ""The Mummy"" ride and ""Jurassic Park"" water ride. I visited on a week-day and most of the other visitors appeared to be foreign tourists. The waiting times for popular rides were around 30-40 minutes, while others had no waiting or queues. Be warned, food and drinks are expensive, like most of these places. Fun for most people, just don't expect it to be as good as the original Universal Studios, or as big as the one in Florida, USA.",Universal Studios Singapore

On weekday mornings, you can ride the attractions with almost no waiting time.  日本のユニバーサル・スタジオに比べると小さくて、半日あれば回れます。 平日の午前中に行ったせいか、待ち時間はほぼ無しでアトラクションに乗れました！ マダガスカルのアトラクションの近くにある売店で売っているかき氷がとっても美味しかったです。",Universal Studios Singapore
Darren D,3.0,"September 20, 2019",Average,We attended on a Monday thinking the park won't be busy and we were right. We were able to get on most rides early. Later some rides had a 70 min wait. The park is small so it won't take long to get around. Be mindful the Jurassic Park raft has about 3cm of water in the bottom so our shoes and socks were wet for the rest of the day as it doesn't drain out. Probably something the park should fix. They offer a $5 drying service after the ride which should be free considering. Overall the park is not great value for money.,Universal Studios Singapore
19Dominique,5.0,"September 20, 2019",What a day,"We recently visited Universal Studios Singapore on Sentosa Island and what a day it was. A must do if you are in Singapore!  We easily spent all day here and just managed to get around all the rides and a couple of shows.  The park is very well designed, goes in a circle.  My suggestion is to get on all the big roller coasters first as the wait time when we were there was 40 minutes compared to 5 minutes when the park first opened.  We didn’t experience long lines, the longest was about 30 minutes for a child friendly ride. Our child was free entry due to age so my suggestion is if you are travelling with young children upgrade the adult tickets to priority so your young isn’t waiting for long for you to come off the big rides, you’ll get on rides a lot quicker. We were told we just missed the peak season.  We went on the rapid ride where the warning was you’ll get wet even soaked our experience yes we got wet but it wasn’t soaked. We didn’t bring rain coats / ponchos and decided to do this at the end of the day. If this is a problem make sure you bring ponchos, you can buy them at the park at a cost of $5  Cold drink fountains are located around the park as well as when you line up for rides. So BYO water bottle. Water will cost approx $4.  Great family fun day out! Will definitely be back when our little one reaches minimum height for all the rides",Universal Studios Singapore

Patrick Glover,5.0,"September 18, 2019",The park is fun,One quick hack is roller coasters are heavily busy in the morning with weight times exceeding 1 hour However after 4 PM they get a little lighter with wait times reduced to 20 minutes or so. So I would suggest to do all the rides with lesser wait times early on and then move to roller coaster.,Universal Studios Singapore
Stephen L,4.0,"September 18, 2019",Exactly what you'd expect,"Exactly like any Universal Studios anywhere. Not nearly as many rides as Universal Studios in Florida but all rides are on the same scale, there are just fewer of them. I'd still recommend purchasing fast passes because even though we were there out of peak season queues were still long. Well known and most popular rides are the Battlestar Galactica rollercoaster rides, Transformers, Shrek, the Waterworld stunt show, and the Lights Camera Action show. There are a number of other rides for both adults and children. Whereas you'd be hard pushed to do everything you would want in Universal Studios Florida, you could actually do everything here within half a day provided you make use of the fast pass option. Definitely worth doing as a distraction from the more traditional sight seeing excursions and kids and adults alike will love it.",Universal Studios Singapore
Unnikrishnan B,4.0,"September 18, 2019",The long queues killed the thrill,"It’s a beautiful fun park with lots of rides but for 10 mins ride you have to be in the queue 1 to 2 hours, some times more. Most of the Singaporeans come there for one or two rides because their pass is valid for one year. So, if you are a tourist and left one day for the studio, then select the must have rides first and try them. Select a week day. The food inside the studio is expensive than outside, but everything is available.",Universal Studios Singapore
Overtoosoon,5.0,"September 17, 2019",Movie lovers must do,Great park. Good rides. Lots of characters and sets to look at. Food is pricey and it’s really hot on Sentosa. Get an express pass it really makes a difference. Good day out 👍,Universal Studios Singapore

Mikaela Koia,2.0,"September 16, 2019",More Movie World than Universal Studios,"I actually was quite disappointed with Universal Studios. It was definitely a theme park but it missed the most important and interesting part from the US park which is the movie making component. It has a lot more similarities to Movie World in Australia.  We were travelling with three autistic children so I am quite aware of observing how many accessibility options are available at this type of tourist venue. There was not a specific disability queue for entry or any kind of quiet/sensory maps or information provided.  We attended the park outside of peak season and school holidays and found the lines for all the rides ridiculously long. A lot of the rides we did try seemed dated/old. The Shrek related 4D movie was interesting but it has a very long build up in an earlier room in which patrons are required to stand for at least 10 minutes. This is not mentioned in the signage and there were no options provided for disabilities. It was also poorly organised where people were put i haphazard lines manually then when the doors opened for entry everyone rushed forward, losing all trace of imagined lines we were placed in.  All in all I think if you can choose one thing on Sentosa to do, it would not be this. I think if we ever have the chance again, we will try out the aquarium.",Universal Studios Singapore
Katestu62,3.0,"September 16, 2019",Fun but not as good as LA,"Short rides with LONG queues, 60 to 90 mins is ridiculous.l wonder if they keep the queues long to encourage you to buy the more expensive express pass.

venochik,4.0,"September 15, 2019",More amusement park than moving making,We found this park a little disappointing compared to the US version just because it was more amusement park orientated then movie making magic.

Morgan D,5.0,"September 15, 2019",So much fun !,"We went to Universal Studios Singapore as soon as we got off our cruise ship and we had such a fun day! They have free wifi around the park and they give you food vouchers which was awesome (a lot less expensive than the Universal Studios in the states). To see my experience, visit my youtube channel: Morgancita. The lines moved fairly quickly and we were able to get on about 10 or so rides by the mid afternoon. If you have the time, I highly recommend visiting. We stayed at the Le Méridien Singapore hotel, so we easily walked (they also have a free monorail).",Universal Studios Singapore

Valene,5.0,"September 14, 2019",Great fun for adults and kids!,"We thoroughly enjoyed our trip to Universal Studios, although waiting in lines can be tiresome it was definitely well worth it.

SJColeman1,2.0,"September 14, 2019",Birthday Holiday,"I was looking forward to Universal Studios but was somewhat disappointed. The one ride I was looking forward to was the mummy and it was closed, but we didn’t get informed of this prior to going even though we had prebooked the tickets and purchased vip entry (which can’t be used on all rides and does not give you direct acces to rides just shortens the queue) as a treat! So we went to go on other rides and some didn’t open until 11 even though the park opened at 10. Then I went to the toilets which were closed for cleaning, THE PARK HAD ONLY JUST OPENED!! Would not go again!",Universal Studios Singapore
pandora m,4.0,"September 14, 2019","Variety of rides, long waiting times and poor food","Love the different rides that suit the different age groups. Our kids 5, 7 and 9 were quite entertained. We have been annual pass holders for several years and here's some tips to share to survive the day with young kids: 1) go early. Q starts as early as 9am. It helps to be first few in the Q as you can wait for an hour for some popular rides. Get a spouse to take turns to Q while kids can play at the fringe (water fountain, chocolate store, sometimes fringe game stores, etc etc) 2) go straight for transformer with older kids (Q can become 60min later in the day). Followed by the 2 rollar coaster rides and mummy ride (all which can have long waiting time). Go for single rider if the Q starts to form. 3) if follow the above it would be around 1045 to 1055. Then standby outside Jurassic world (which opens at 11am). A natural queue will usually normally form but there is no need/point to Q. You just stand behind the rope (as directed by staff). Then go for the dino boat ride and canopy flyer.  By now, you would have cleared all the rides that normally you would need to wait for more than 1/2h. Spend the afternoon doing all the shows (e.g. Lights Camera Action, Sesame street, Shrek etc etc ) - weather is very hot in Singapore. Last hour you can go for the dragon ride if you have missed it (not much Q by then) and Madagascar boat ride (no Q by that time).  If kids are not old enough to sit mummy ride and big roller coasters but are tall enough for the dragon and puss in boots rollar coaster then go for that when it opens (both rides also tend to have long waiting time during the day).  Food wise. A lot of options but very pricey and unhealthy. Nothing very suitable for young children and they don't allow us to bring in food, even snack bread or grapes for the kids. Yes, I was told to rent a locker outside to put my kids' grapes (of course we refused and ate it up on the spot - it was just a small box). There are many food options outside. However, if you have no particular food restrictions then it is fine.  Enjoy!",Universal Studios Singapore
BonoAussie,5.0,"September 13, 2019",Universal appeal,"Universal Studios Singapore is an adventurous and exciting outing sure to thrill the whole family.  The Battlestar Galactica roller coasters are fantastic, and well worth mustering your courage to experience.  The food, beverages, gift shops, and professional photography services are as over-priced as you’d expect at a theme park, but that’s part of the charm (and worth budgeting for).  The Waterworld stunt show is extremely impressive and entertaining. Definitely worth seeing.  Lockers: We recommend renting a property locker at the main entrance, if you turn right immediately after entering the gate, rather than the lockers near attractions within the park. That way you can pay $15 as a once-off expense while accessing and re-locking as often as you like.",Universal Studios Singapore
Lani B,5.0,"September 13, 2019",Loved it!!,"The park is smaller than other parks in the USA and Japan, but it was still great to visit. The rides were great and so were the staff. All very polite and friendly, as you would expect in the all the Universal Studio Parks. Definitely glad I went, and I would probably go again if given the opportunity. It was very easy to get too. We used a mixture of taxi's and public transport. If staying in Marina Bay (like we did), it is a short taxi ride. Food options and merchandise was great. Lots of options and the gift stores were fully stocked.  As for peoples complaints in previous reviews. Yes it is hot and humid, but you probably should have noted this before booking your trip to Singapore. Coming from Australia, we had a slight advantage as the weather is the same as our summer. All travellers should check the weather before planning your trips. If you don't like/cannot stand hot and humid weather, don't book a trip to a place where the seasons are hot and hotter. Make sure you are prepared for the day out. Wear loose clothing and a hat when outdoors, comfortable shoes, bring a water bottle, and a fan or umbrella if you want too.  And complaining about queues is a little dim. Its a theme park that is very popular with a wide range of age groups. Yes there will be queues. If you don't want to line up for a roller coaster or to get a photo with your favourite character. I suggest going in non-peak periods of the year or time of day, or upgrade your tickets to use the fast pass options. You could also do like my husband and I, and use the single rider lines. Often they are less than half the wait of the normal line, and the ride will be the same no matter who you sit next to.  All in all, the park was great. It is small, but there are other attractions as Sentosa Island if you still have some time to spare.",Universal Studios Singapore
VacationerGuy,4.0,"September 13, 2019","Small, but fun","This place is tiny, not just by universal parks standards, but by theme park standards in general. They've crammed a full days worth of entertainment into the small park, though. The highlight for me was the Mummy and the Jurassic Park section. Water World is also very cool. Staff were friendly. Many food options, though not a lot of options in each individual restaurant. On a friday in September, queues were long, but not more than an hour in most cases. Single rider line helps. If you dont see a single rider line, ask staff about it. Many times I was asked if I was solo and sent up the Express lane with a special 'single rider' ticket. This saved me loads of time standing in line. Some of the attractions could you use a fresh coat of paint (Jurassic park seemed far too dated already for a park this new). The odd thing was, walking around, this felt like a cheaper park imitating a universal Studios park, not the real deal. It was still lots of fun, though, and well worth a visit.",Universal Studios Singapore

HungryForMoreMum,3.0,"September 13, 2019","Not fun in hazy, humid weather",Rides and express ticket were good however even the shaded areas were baking hot today meaning my 7 old year preferred to stay in the air conditioned shops which isn’t really the point of such an expensive ticket price. We left after only a few hours because she asked to return to Changi Jewel because it is air conditioned. We are Australians by the way so are accustomed to hot summers.  Would we go again on a hazy humid day like today ? No. Would be consider it in cooler weather ? Maybe but only maybe as daughter had more fun at Jewel.,Universal Studios Singapore

Zee,5.0,"September 10, 2019",Amazing experience !!!,"Bought the ticket from Klook. Just scan the e-ticket at the entrance without need to collect the physical ticket. Very convenient. For those plan to visit in the future. Be smart and strategize which ride u want to go first. I aimed for the thrill rides first. Once entered, we straightaway go or ‘run’ to the rides. So, less waiting time there. I was the first to ride the battlestar galactica rides. After the thrill rides, only we went to other rides while enjoying & taking photos. By late afternoon, managed to ride 2nd time battlestar galactica & Transformer ride with waiting time 30mins. Still ok. Didn’t managed to take 2nd time for Revenge of mummy as i felt backpain. The price for food&drinks are pricey, given like any other theme park. So plan & spend wisely if you want especially if you bring kids. No outside food& drinks allowed, they check your bag. So be warned. Also plan & choose the schedule when to visit to avoid super crowded.",Universal Studios Singapore

Don't expect the large roller coaster experience of the Universal Studios Hollywood, but the shops, shows and food are all reminiscent of Hollywood. You probably should arrive early and head to the Roller Coaster or Transformer ride or other favorite ride to get in that line before it gets too long. They look like they can be very long at times!

After I closed the locker, and boarded I was told to take up my cap, and put my sunglasses in my pocket, and held my cap. The way the ride went up and down, I thought that I was going to lose my cap, and sunglasses. To me it was a very scary ride, and wondered if I would make it out of there alive. I bought a grape slush at one of the kiosks it was good but, very overpriced for $7.",Universal Studios Singapore
WSA,4.0,"September 7, 2019",Fantastic theme park,Well maintained theme park in Sentosa island in Singapore. Rides are generally fun and well kept. Staff are ok.

Eat Drink Dean,3.0,"September 7, 2019",Not that exciting,"The studio only had 3 exciting rides (the Mummy indoor rollercoaster was closed on our visit) so the SGD$80 entrance fee + SGD$100 Unlimited Fast Pass (allows you to skip the lines for most of the rides - you can also get a SGD$79 Fast Pass which only allows you only 1 skip per ride) we felt was not value for money.  If you do go make sure to eat at the Malaysian Food Centre which is located just outside of the entrance (they allow you to exit and re-enter, just make sure you get a re-entry stamp) the food is better and cheaper.",Universal Studios Singapore
mjdavis66,5.0,"September 7, 2019",Universal Studios,"We arrived early and waited in line as reviews said it was the best way to get on some rides before the crowds. We were lucky enough to get picked out of the front of the line by a Universal staff member to be the family that opens the park, they do this everyday. We were taken to a private room in the offices which had signed posters of all the famous artists that had visited and told to wait. They provided our family of 3 with free express ride passes for the day and discounted food and gift vouchers. We then were taken back to the entrance and while a little crowd show was going on before the glares opened introduced us and we then officially open the park for the day. The park itself was great, we had no problems getting on any rides even without the passes although we didn’t bother with the main roller coasters as too scarey for our son. Overall great day and can’t thank universal studios enough as it was our son birthday , also the water world show is amazing do not miss",Universal Studios Singapore

farbie67,3.0,"September 6, 2019",Fun day but could’ve been better,Firstly the staff that welcome you on to the rides or experiences could look like they’re enjoying their day. I understand it’s hot but as a visitor you want to be welcomed by the staff. Instead most of them barely make eye contact and look really miserable. We are here to have fun! Even though the queues are long thank god you are in shelter so it’s not too bad! 1 hour for the transformer ride was the longest we had to endure but it was worth it. The others? 45 mins for the Shrek ride which lasted 50 seconds??? We did it twice but in the scheme of things it is a long wait for such a short ride. Be prepared. Don’t waste your money on the express queue as you could be waiting a while anyway. All in all we had a good day but we didn’t have to worry about taking children. To any one who takes children you deserve a medal and I mean that in the nicest way ☺️,Universal Studios Singapore

The white knuckle rides were not,they reminded me of alton towers from the 80s. The shows were equally disappointing and should be avoided unless you have small children because the humour was obviously plugged towards that age. Overall the place was worth a visit but if you were expecting uk or American style roller coasters, you will be disappointed.",Universal Studios Singapore

RSBUk,3.0,"September 5, 2019",Queues Queues Queues!,"We visited on an off peak day and even then it was packed. We bought Express passes, which were S$70 on top of the $S79 tickets... So it is a lot of money and you STILL have queues of 60mins in the Express lane on the main rides which is a joke. They sell far too many express passes which spoils the experience. I felt for those without them as the queues were over 2 hours for the main rides... the park is only open for 8 hours so you won't get to see much at all! I don't think it was worth the money as rides were closed (Revenge of the Mummy) and several encountered tech issues while we were there (Transformers, Battlestar Humans, Jurassic Rapid ride).",Universal Studios Singapore

Jenny Lyn Metil... T,4.0,"September 4, 2019",Fambam in Universal Studios Singapore,"It was a superb experience for the entire family of 4 (my hubby, myself and 2 kids) who really enjoyed every memorable second spent at Universal Studios Singapore .  It was a family getaway at the same time an advance birthday treat for our eldest son who will turn 7 years old come next month. He is pretty much a diehard fan of Transformers especially that of Bumblebee. He even went to USS in Bumblebee costume. He rode the Transformers ride for 5 times not minding the queue at all... We had so much fun that he calls it the best day of his life.  It is expected though that it would be a bit expensive treat. So ready your pockets to be deep enough. Save early and diligently. One more tip for guests and travelers, be mindful too of the weather conditions as although Singapore City usually is of fine 27-29 degrees warm, but part of tropical region as it is, even light rain pours could affect some rides and attractions. We had a slightly slow start due to rain showers but had a bit too warm situation when it stopped.  Nevertheless, forces of nature are out of anyone’s control...And that overall it really was an excellent day at USS! A must on everyone’s bucket list! Checked on mine! :)",Universal Studios Singapore

You have an option of regular entry as well as express entry at an additional charge.

So many guest in park ,However Mummy closed due to maintenance , Transformer ride system trouble , Elmos is also system trouble. So many attractions closed. Even 80min of waiting time for Jurassic World for EXPRESS LANE. even 60min for roller coaster. I never seen before as such worst theme park in W/W.  Almost staff in USS are No hospitality , No supporting and No Smile. We found smiled guys who asked guest to take photo and selling it. Only USS is only considering how to get $ from Guest. All of staff in USS should be going to Tokyo Disney land to study how support for GUEST at first.  Strongly recommend for all of tourist from Japan to Singapore , Pls DO NOT GO USS. Again.  全ての日本からのお客様にアドバイスをします。 ユニバーサルシンガポールはお金と時間を無駄にする世界で有数の場所です。 ここに行くくらいならば、シンガポール動物園、水族館等の方が良いです。 ユニバーサルスタジオの雰囲気を味わうのであれば、ユニバーサルスタジオジャパンの方が100倍良いです。",Universal Studios Singapore

YJacklin,2.0,"August 31, 2019",Massive queues and closed rides!,If you've been to Universal in Florida you will probably be disappointed here. It's a very small park. We arrived in the morning and all the Express tickets were ready sold out. The mummy ride was closed all day. There were 90 minute to 3 hour waits for every ride. We only got to do two all day but did catch the show. Not really worth the money if you can't get on any rides!,Universal Studios Singapore
Kristina B,3.0,"August 31, 2019",Uninspiring Universal,"For an adult, this universal isn’t much to shout about. The transformers ride needs to be updated as the 3D visuals are lacking and the Human/Cyclone rollercoaster broke down on our visit. There’s not many other rides that give you a thrill so it’s catered mainly for kids. Huge tip: cue in the Single Riders lane as it saves you SO much time (and it’s not often you end up being separated!). OR definitely buy fast track passes - the wait times can be ridiculous.  Food is poor so bring your own!",Universal Studios Singapore
Miss Tere,4.0,"August 30, 2019",Happy Place Indeed,If you have been to Universal Studios in the USA well Don’t expect the that Universal Studios Singapore was big as the USA it was actually smaller but nevertheless you may enjoy the whole place. For me my best ride was the transformers and I think this ride was only available in SG. You cant ride all the rides here in a day due to the very long que while waiting well if you have an extra money you may want to buy an express pass ticket which is more pricey than the ordinary ticket. There are many food restaurant inside so no need to worry if you’re hungry or you may go outside too near sentosa for those food establishments.,Universal Studios Singapore
Must Do Travels,5.0,"August 30, 2019",Universal Studios Singapore Experience,"I love it, we had a blast. Though we only have a day to tour the entire theme park, we made sure to book online and try all the rides as we can. It was a fun and tiring experience. I'm so happy as I've met Bumble Bee and Optimus Prime :)",Universal Studios Singapore
Joshua A,3.0,"August 30, 2019",Good but extremely crowded.,Lots of people everywhere long ride wait times in excess of an hour some up to 2 hours extremely hard to find tables at restaurants. Long wait in lines for food I enjoyed our day out here however I don’t think I would return if I was in Singapore again,Universal Studios Singapore
Azusa H,3.0,"August 30, 2019",They have a serious problem with the waiting time estimation.,"The waiting time was usually inaccurate. A supposed 5 minute wait at the Madagascar crate ride turned out to be closer to 50 (we joked that it was missing the 0). Also, the ""common"" board published a different waiting time then the actual board at the attraction itself (happened to me for Puss in Boots - 5 mins on the common board and 60 on the attraction board. Correct timing is the 60.) The boards are annoying also because they keep changing to useless messages and then you have to wait forever for the waiting time to come back (if you felt confident enough to trust it anyway). It sucks that there is no reliable system where you can look at the waiting time and plan (at one point i was doing this running back and forth because I couldn't find out the correct waiting time for my target ride). I know queuing can't be avoided but at least the correct information should be made available somewhere so that we can at least decide what to do based on the wait time. Luckily the 25 minute wait advertised for Enchanted airways was reasonably close (Maybe I queued 35 mins in reality).  It was okay I guess but looks better in pictures than in person. The walk to Waterworld was particularly ugly and uninspiring. Felt like a waste of space with nothing to see. It kind of felt like they got bored and ran out of ideas on how to make it pretty. Or maybe it's a work in progress.  The halal option for food was ok: we ate at Marty's food court which I really enjoyed. Portions are large so we shared. Expensive but well.  The mummy ride was closed: I wish there was system where we could be notified earlier (but considering that we would already have chosen our travel date much earlier, maybe it couldn't be helped, especially if the maintenance is adhoc? I certainly didn't remember seeing the maintenance notice when I was looking through the website doing research but that was months in advance of my stay). Maybe something at the point of time before we purchase the ticket? Thankfully I'm a bit of a scaredy cat so although I was disappointed I wasn't crushed.  I managed to do 6 rides and 3 shows (with too much time wasted queuing for the deceptive boat ride) in about 7 hours. Which reminds me: when I was doing research earlier, I felt like I saw a scheduled closing time of 7pm, but this ended up to be 6pm on the actual day. I know all these are subject to changes but it was still annoying, because you can't expect us to keep checking the calendar every single day. I plan trips way in advance so such last minute changes are annoying.  The only reason i managed to get to do more than I thought I could was because of the staff spotting that I was a single rider, so that was nice.",Universal Studios Singapore
daniela1234224,4.0,"August 30, 2019",Fun day at busy Universal Studios Singapore,"Went on a Monday to try & avoid crowds but it didn't halp, the place was BUSY! Great park layout, lots of different themed areas to visit & much to see! Long looong wait times for rides (up to 190 minutes for the popular ones like Battlestar Gallactica & Transformers) so I suggest you arrive right on 10am opening time & do rides ASAP otherwise you'll spend most of the day in lines. Park closed at 6pm which is too early! Plenty of choices for food (expensive, however) & overall we enjoyed ourselves. Could have spent longer there if we weren't ushered out at 6. Regular entry tickets cost SG$80 each, Express Pass for 4 rides was additional SG$120 per person & unlimited Express Pass an additional SG$140 per person, so it could have cost us SG$220 each - totally ridiculous! We just got the regular tickets & managed to get on 4 rides through the day. I'm glad we went but not sure we'd do it again.",Universal Studios Singapore
Greg,5.0,"August 30, 2019",Great experience,Had been to Singapore couple of times before but never had a chance to visit this place before. Bought a ticket from a local agent for the day. It’s a full days excursion but I could not finish the whole thing. All in all it was good experience and worth the money. Food and beverage is bit overpriced and don’t think of taking any food from out to the park coz it’s not allowed. Recommend anyone to take the MRT from wherever you stay to Santosa.,Universal Studios Singapore
LushFG,5.0,"August 29, 2019",Great Access Arrangements,We visited after pre-arranging Access Arrangements as I am disabled. Brilliant efficient service and the rides were well organised and great fun. Varied selection of fast food and restaurant outlets to cater to all tastes. Loved the Shrek themes area and Jurassic World best.,Universal Studios Singapore
Denom S,3.0,"August 29, 2019",Excruciating hours of waiting time,"Universal Studios Singapore was a very unique and a thrilling experience. Enjoyed the different rides and themes. Unfortunately, what I didn't agree was the express pass system. It is completely unacceptable and unfair for the normal ticket holders. Also, the waiting time for each ride was unbelievably long. The management should come up with a solution to reduce the waiting time. The photographers at the photography booth were not professional nor efficient in getting the photos printed quickly.",Universal Studios Singapore
SRKK2013,5.0,"August 28, 2019",Really Universal,We went with the pass for Universal as well as sentosa. There were long ques. We reached early so that we can enter early in some of the very popular rides. My children enjoyed it to the fullest. One need to check the show timing of special events. We went for one day but minimum two days required,Universal Studios Singapore
64AnnaLY,2.0,"August 28, 2019",Average at best!,Visited with two other adult family members on a Monday. Queue for monorail to Sentosa was awful. Made the decision to walk over the boardwalk on our way back. As the entry wasn't cheap for a comparatively small park we decided not to purchase the express passes as at an additional $300 for all of us it seemed very expensive. As a result we suffered the queues! Apparently the wait for the rapids was 2 hours 40 mins - we queued for over 3hrs 30! We managed 3 rides in a whole day! Not good value for money! Food outlets were busy again with huge queues. Just glad we didn't have young children with us. If I visited Singapore again I wouldn't bother to return.,Universal Studios Singapore
Sigit Mul,4.0,"August 28, 2019",Prayer Room,"There is prayer room, location between Sci-Fi City (Galactica) and Ancient Egypt, nice place to pray for Muslims even it small but clean and comfort.",Universal Studios Singapore
Stefanie W,4.0,"August 28, 2019",A fun and thrilling day!,"My husband and I visited Universal Studios Singapore last month and we had a blast! I would highly recommend to buy the fast pass ticket especially during high season as it’s at least a 2 hour wait for a ride. Even though this Universal Studio is not as large as the one in LA, the rides were great, the food was somewhat average, and the staff were just lovely. It was a very busy day when we went and all the staff were attentive and helpful. We were pleasantly surprised when a staff member Leng Chew approached us and asked us if we needed any assistance (as we were holding up the map trying to figure out our bearings). He was so helpful, showed us where we were and the best rides to go on. He even offered to take some photos of us which was very thoughtful. An overall memorable day!",Universal Studios Singapore
Jieshi,3.0,"August 28, 2019",Amazing place!,"Its a little smaller than the other Universal Studios. The rides are still fun, would recommend Transformers. Downside is weather is too hot and queue was long!",Universal Studios Singapore
Hilmar Horst D,2.0,"August 27, 2019",DISAPPOINTING DAY FOR LITTLE ONES.,"Had been planning this day out for some time, and had been to theme parks before this one, but we thought that at $79 for adults and $59 for the kids, it would be a fun day for all of us.The no food or drink check at the gate should have warned us, having to pay $4 for a bottle of water inside for 5 kids was not a good start.The food choices inside were the usual venues, and actually reasonably priced, but the wait times were horrid! Even from the get go, the queue's at the rides were long and tedious when you are trying to contain young children, and no other entertainment was offered to perhaps entertain the queue's waiting in the sun, at times for up to an hour for a brief ride of a couple of minutes. We found it hard to explain to the children about why some children just walked past the queue and got on the ride we had been waiting to get on for some time. This is the "" benefit' of the $110 express ticket on top of your entry price, which gets you to the front for the first ride, then you queue up with the main queue afterwards. However, the $140 unlimited ride was a real hard one to explain to them, as several children and adults just got off the ride, walked around us and got back on again. Try explaining that to a restless pair of 6 year olds, who are bored to tears, and getting very hot out here in the sun after over an hour waiting. Seriously not a good day, and some testy conversations with overworked staff did not help this situation at all. Cannot recollect this ever happening at any other park where staff have been helpful and eager to assist young children. Sorry, but we will not be back again.",Universal Studios Singapore
Joanna T,2.0,"August 26, 2019",Worst Day Ever,"We visited on a Thursday to try and avoid the queues. We had pre-purchased tickets online but then had to queue to buy monorail tickets to get to Sentosa. The day was awful....despite spending 8 hours at the park we only managed 5 rides as every ride had at least 60 - 90 minute queue. The queues all had ""estimated wait time"" but we found wait time was always at least 30 minutes more than estimate. Our 7 & 9 year old children enjoyed the rides we did do but we all agreed we'd never go again. We had experienced other theme parks in Australia (Gold Coast) and loved that but would never go to Universal Studios Singapore again.  Our children really wanted to do the two big roller coasters but we didn't manage to do either as we checked wait time on 3 occasions during the day and waiting time was always estimated at 90 minutes.  Don't waste your time or money to visit this park",Universal Studios Singapore
MezzTherese,3.0,"August 26, 2019",Disappointing,"Went with my 27 year old daughter. Bought our entrance ticket with all intentions of purchasing the express pass. I had seen prices of 40-80 dollars for the express pass. When we got in we found the express pass to be another $110 . This on top of the original ticket seemed a bit ridiculous. My daughter went to go on the roller coaster. Outside it said a wait of 80 minutes and after queuing for 20 mins she was then told the wait was a further 120 minutes. She walked out. The express wait was 30 minutes. All the other adult rides had a similar wait time. We wandered around a decided to leave for a late lunch and return later. At 3pm the roller coasters had a wait time of 180 minutes and express wait of 60 minutes. Other adult rides were 90 mins to 180 mins wait. The park was very crowded so this would account for the wait times. Admittedly we are use to the Australian theme parks which are bigger. Universal was clean and staff lovely. We arrived just after 10am to what looked live a huge queue but were through the gates in 10 minutes. You can’t take in outside food , water was fine to take in. Plenty of places to sit and rest. I feel it catered more to younger families. If you are a young adult go with people of a similar age and buy the express pass and still be prepared to wait.",Universal Studios Singapore
melissa h,5.0,"August 26, 2019",All About Queue,"If You want to go to this place maybe better Monday to Thursday, because if you go on Friday, very full of people and queue for almost every attraction like At Jurassic Park Rapid Adventure take around 30 minutes and canopy flyer also take 30 minutes, and at Revenge of the mummy 3 Hours because that attraction is the best attraction at this place",Universal Studios Singapore
Mimi0267,3.0,"August 26, 2019",Long queues,"We went on Saturday, our last day before returning to London.  It was very hot and the queues were over 90 minutes wait! Bearing in mind it closes at 7pm ) opens at 10am, you have no enough time to go to all the rides.  It was a good day out but we could have done with a longer opening time to be able to try other rides.  I am not sure why the close so early, be aware if you go between Monday and Thursdays they close even earlier at 6pm!",Universal Studios Singapore
Katka Babik,2.0,"August 26, 2019",Never again!,"Universal Studios was amazing but we had to wait at least 2,5 hours for each atraction! In that hot weather... We spent there for about 6 hours and we saw only one attraction (in jurassic park) which was 10 minutes long. Mumia and transformers attraction was closed.

Dian,3.0,"August 26, 2019",It's OK,"It's an OK park. The rides are so so, not 4D. I can just go to a carnival here for those rides LOL. The only 4D adventure was Shrek.

Varun J,4.0,"August 25, 2019",Good park but can be overcrowded,Nice park with some decent rides.

Tia,5.0,"August 25, 2019",Fabulous and Fantastic!,It’s beautiful fun place.. so much to explore.

Darren C,2.0,"August 25, 2019",Pretty Average,"Universal itself was okay but definitely not the best one we’ve been to. It was spoilt by the long waiting times & to add to our frustration large groups of Indians cutting in on all the queues for the rides. Experienced altercations and threatening between Indians & other people queuing, Spoilt our day. Food & drink was very expensive & very small positions. No way near the same experiences we had at Universals in the US, they would never tolerate this behaviour.",Universal Studios Singapore
Jonas L,4.0,"August 24, 2019",Nice attractions but loong waiting time,The park has good attractions but really you need buy those fastrack pass to enjoy the experience as the lines for the attractions really takes time even for a line that’s relatively not that long and this was on a thurs non holdiday day so I can just imagine what the weekend would look like. You also have to deal with the heat which really drains you out. Food is quite expensive inside but there are plenty of options just outside the park,Universal Studios Singapore
Ahmed A,4.0,"August 24, 2019",Great place for friends and family,The rides are fun and in good condition. On the negative side it is too crowded and I expected more space. I loved camera light action and the shrek journey,Universal Studios Singapore
Jayantha w,3.0,"August 24, 2019",High time to do overall refurbishment,I had been visiting this place over 4 years and place is becoming so filthy. All most all the figures walls to the buildings will require a coat of paint and revamped. With the mo ey they charge better to close down and do a full refurbishment altogether. As most railings are discoloured would carry germs as thousands of pepole touch those. Also in the cinemas and effects olaces 3 D glasses should be sanitauzed as many wear those and carry germs. Singapore as country sucks the tourists but give very few back to us for the money we spent in your MAN MADE COUNTRY.,Universal Studios Singapore
tranzactnow,4.0,"August 24, 2019",Enjoy!!!,"Difficult to add value as a reviewer when so many reviews have been written so here are a few dot points 1. If you are going, spend the extra and by the Universal Express pass or don't go at all. Rides that had wait times of 100 minutes for standard tickets we got on in 10 2. Buy your tickets and Express pass as early as you can as in when you make your holiday bookings for Singapore. Don't wait until the day before. The express pass has dynamic pricing and goes up 3. Give the opening a miss, go half an hour later and you get in quickly and miss nothing as long as you have the express pass 4. Difficult to find much in the way of healthy food - you expect that I suppose at places like this 5. The park is not like Universal Studios Hollywood. It is not a movie production venue for a start. I have been to the LA one and Singapore. Both were good but Singapore is not LA and not the home of Universal Studios. 6. Take some rest stops during the day 7. Yes it is expensive, but you will likely spend 7 hours there. For us with the express pass it was $170 each. Works out at $25 per hour. How many times will you do it in your life? Enjoy!!!",Universal Studios Singapore
Habib M,1.0,"August 24, 2019",lost taime,The worst option I can choose. You must wait 45 minutes in a queue to enter the game or a theater show no more than 5 minutes. Value is not worth the money.

Kael P,4.0,"August 24, 2019","Good, but not the best universal studios","We went on a Monday, expecting queues to be slightly smaller.  Rides still had wait times of 2.5 hours during the middle of the day, and fast passes had sold out by 11am!  The park itself was fun, with a lot to look and do, but we felt it was maybe to squashed into its limited area, comparative to other universal parks.  We also found the locker system to be bemusing, offering 45 minutes free before charging. When we were told we were not allowed our wallets on a ride, we were forced to get help as we had exceeded the 45 minutes before attempting to get our stuff out again - as we could not pay.",Universal Studios Singapore

Sal,1.0,"August 22, 2019",Beware of your belongings,"I decided to visit Universal studios in Singapore as part my part. Now, there are many tourists there , so sometimes impossible to enjoy the parks games. In park we forget our go pro camera 6 black edition at one of game. We came in less than 3 minutes, but wasn’t there. We asked guy who collected items that I hope keep camera and he said not found. I went to customer service center lost and found. I stopped in long queue and at end write long form. After , two hours I came to ask them and the said that no one brought my camera. I asked them to check camera they say we will wait 24 hour??? I tried to talk to someone but they not listen to you. At last hour good manager duty met me after I explain my problem with services and ask security to check camera. They found guy steal my camera when I left one of game area. They ask guards to stop this guy , but time was late to response. Any way I stayed until close time . Later , I opened police case and they have record of guy who came though travel agency. Singapore just called me one time and after I’m sending them lot of emails and not response. In End in Singapore which has strong police no body ask travel agency about guy name which they have recorded with clear face. So, please be carful of items as camera and mobile.",Universal Studios Singapore

Average waiting time for the big ride is 60 to 100 minutes while other rides and show 20 to 30 minutes. Not sure if express pass is worth of money because all the rides is very short.They let too many people in for such a small park, it's not enough rides for everybody resulted in long queues .

DandAMelbourne,3.0,"August 22, 2019",Very annoying,"We bought our tickets online so stright to the turnstiles and in, but what was very annoying is reading the sign for the ride and it telling you it was a 40 minute wait and then queueing up for an hour, but then on the secound ride it was down for 30 minutes and ended up being 100 minutes, if we had known that we wouldn't have bothered, so that was the only rides we done, so been there done that and wouldn't bother going again.",Universal Studios Singapore
AsithK,3.0,"August 21, 2019","Great Attractions, Long Queues","We went on a Monday thinking that there would be less crowds but oh boy! we couldn't have been more wrong. Even though we went around the park opening time, there were long queues to enter the park and almost all the main attractions especially for Battlestar Galactica and Revenge of the Mummy (Waiting time was around 90 mins for each of these).  They don't allow any mobile phones, wallets etc. to be brought into Battlestar Galactica, so you have to keep them in the lockers outside which they provide for free for a certain amount of time. (When the time exceeds, you have to pay)  Both Battlestar Galactica and Revenge of the Mummy were excellent rides despite the extended waiting times and we really enjoyed them. Especially ""Cylon"" at Battlestar Galactica is not for the faint-hearted.",Universal Studios Singapore

Normgirl,3.0,"August 19, 2019",Good but huge lines,"I love US but the lines here were crazy! I didn’t pre buy my ticket and there were only three booths to buy them so the wait was about 30 minutes. Then you line up to go through gate - another 20 minutes. Just madness. And it was a Monday. I didn’t get the express pass as I was on my own and it made the day VERY expensive but without it the wait was terrible. Even with it I saw quite a wait for those people at some rides. The wait prediction times were out on every ride. One took an hour longer than the sign indicated, which if it had been correct I wouldn’t have bothered. To eat, I exited and went to the food hall at Sentosa. Had a heap of food hawker stalls so it was great. I did look to eat at US and went to one restaurant but was told I couldn’t get a table until 3pm. Strange as nearly all the outside tables were empty. Overall, not the best US experience. I probably would go again if I was in Singapore but I wouldn’t stopover there specifically to go. Which is what I did this trip.",Universal Studios Singapore

It is worth a day trip but if you are an adrenaline junky only a few big rides. My partner doesn't really do big rides but once I got him on them he loved it. My favourite was The Mummy.

Alessa,2.0,"August 19, 2019",Overrun and overpriced,"We went on a Monday early in the morning hoping to avoid the crowds...how naive we were. Already getting to Sentosa with the sentosa express from Vivo city felt like a marketplace with people screaming, pushing and cutting lines. At universal studios it was no better.We were here several years ago and the park itself has not expanded much. Although we really enjoyed it the last time, this trip was rather unpleasant. Every ride had a long waiting period, for the jurassic park line it was !!3!!!! hours for the normal line! Despite our express pass we still had long waiting times ranging from 15min to an hour. Very irritating were passengers cutting lines f.e. at the Mummy ride. Luckily the staff at universal turned everyone who cut the line without the express pass away. However the resulting discussions and arguing resulted in further hold up of the ride... Things have changed a lot in the last few years and the park CANNOT keep up with the increasing number of tourists. If you have the possibility to visit Universal studios somewhere else, do that. We have also been to Japan and Orlando recently and both were so much better. Additionally but expected, prices are exorbitant... Biggest joke is that lockers are charged after 60 min, while waiting times like already mentioned often exceed the 60minutes.",Universal Studios Singapore
Liz,5.0,"August 18, 2019",A great day out !,"We went to Singapore universal studios this week.

The food is expensive but does the job, the different themed areas are nice and the castle looked beautiful. Be sure to stay till night and see the lovely coloured lights go on and change the ambience of the place.

Rabzie,5.0,"August 18, 2019",Great Theme Park,"This is a good theme park to visit on Sentosa island. However one needs to ensure to get here very early in the morning, I would recommend going on a weekday would be way better than weekends. They have rides for all ages from small kids to the older ones. We managed to do most of them. Please ensure to carry your drink bottles with you as it gets pretty hot and keeping yourself hydrated is essential oh and sun screen too to protect your skin from the sun. The waiting queues are a bit crazy sometimes when it rains they close off most of the rides I don’t really know what the reason may be. The mummy roller coaster ride is a must for grown ups. The Madagascar one for younger kids is a lovely ride. The place has lots of eating places for food/drinks from every section has its own food. Try to make the most of your day out with your family and kids as this place lots to offer it’s a bit pricy though but totally worth it I must say. You can take a picture pass at the entrance once you enter inside where one can do all the rides and etc and you can keep scanning the code or ticket they issue you with to save your pictures which works out much cheaper than purchasing each picture individually for every ride. Once your done you can ask them and they print them all out for you. I would love to visit this place again one day!!",Universal Studios Singapore

Well trust me, they were right. The average line was 80 minutes. The more populate were attractions were much longer. We spent $87.00 which included a “lunch”, however when we got the voucher it is only for $5.00 and the cheapest meal is $16.00, so don’t fall for the meal ticket valid anywhere in the park. They do have an express line for $110.00 sg. I guess if you have to go, it would be worth the difference to buy the $110.00 ticket. Still waiting lines but I’m sure shorter times.

klm899,1.0,"August 17, 2019",AVOID - Not worth your time or money!,"When your 5 year old says it was “the worst day of my life” she might be being dramatic but it was certainly the worst day of our holiday, by some margin. 4 rides all day and they weren’t even good.  If you want to spend a day of your holiday in a very expensive queue then this is the place for you... if not then go elsewhere as there are much better places in Singapore that are a) not a rip-off and b) way more fun.  The amount of express pass holders means it isn’t worth going unless you are willing to fork out the extortion extra money for one. If you are prepared to do that then still expect to queue.  Express Passes: the number of people with them renders any indicated waiting time meaningless as that waiting time may well double...  Rides: they aren’t very good, in fact most of them are pretty naff and also ridiculously quick. In all honesty, the rides at our local Easter fairground are better!  Cost: ridiculous, from the entry charge down to the food and drinks. If you are crazy enough to go there then take a refillable water bottle and a picnic. Glad we did!

Rommel Irwan,3.0,"August 17, 2019",Hot & humid; Stay hydrated!!,"We came on a Friday but it was packed to the brim with tourists around the world. Here are some tips:  1) Get an express pass earlier. Purchase through Klook or any websites. Some attractions took us 120 minutes to queue!!  2) If you don’t have an express pass; opt for single rider. Save you lots of time!!  3) Bring a water bottle. Refill stations are everywhere even in the middle of a queue to any rides  4) Wear light & cooling cloths. Bring extra shirt. I was soaked wet after the Rapid Falls at the Lost World. But totally worth it  5) Use a sunblock and don’t forget your shades/caps etc  6) When you buy a soft drink or a set meal; you will get a plastic cup with a straw. Use this to refill your soft drinks or slush at any drinks counter at a cheaper rate. No point getting canned drinks at SGD$4.00/can when you can refill for SGD$3.00/drink  7) Don’t miss these: - Waterworld Show - Rapid Falls - Puss in Boots Giant Journey - Donkey Comedy Show - there is one where they usher you into a studio and let you experience movie effects of a hurricane in a boat shelter at a New York harbour  8) Food is so-so & expensive. Food options here pale in comparison to Universal Studios Japan - lots of food option available outside; get a stamp, go out & eat your meal then come back in  9) Morning: try visit Madagascar, Far Far Away land & Lost World Afternoon: it’s hot, spend some time at the Hollywood section, chill, go for lunch & stay hydrated Evening: continue to the rest of the attraction",Universal Studios Singapore

Then to make it worse further delays due to issues with rides.  Even buying express does not guarantee that the wait times will be reduced and you can't even use express on some of the family rides.

The more popular attractions have 90 to 120 minutes plus waiting time which is ridiculous. Don’t want to wait? Express pass will cost you another 120 dollar per person. Oh wait, that’s only if you want to do the attraction once. Want to go again? Buy the pass for 120 plus dollar. Feeling thirsty? Get a bottle of water for 8 dollars.

I felt a bit guilty walking past the long lines, especially at one point the wait times for some rides (the Jurassic Park one) was 120 min wait time which is absolutely crazy, with the express I had a 45 min wait for this ride. The Mummy Returns rollercoaster was my absolute favourite and the battle star galactica was also impressive. The Transformers 3D adventure was an excellent immersive experience, I found my way in there because my feet needed a rest and safe to say I was blown away by this ride. The food was just food, nothing to get too excited about but did the job of filling my tummy.

greytokyo,4.0,"August 12, 2019",Universal Express cards went missing at Cylon,"Our Universal Express passes went missing today. Left them on the shelving during the Cylon roller coaster ride and they were gone when we went to retrieve them.  It was extra crowded today with the public holiday. They had two sets of cars running which helped moved the line along. However, as people getting off the ride went to retrieve their cards and glasses, people getting on the ride were rushing to leave their items on the shelving. This is not safe - hope Universal will ensure riders leave the area before the next group approaches the shelving.  I was quite upset at losing the cards but Guest Services were wonderful- helped us print out new cards and voided the missing ones.",Universal Studios Singapore
Bruce R,5.0,"August 11, 2019",Fun day,"It's not as big as the one in L.A. but that makes it more fun. But if you don't want to spend your day in a long line for every ride, the front of line pass is a must. Yes it costs you a bit but what's the use of going there and not doing anything. The rides are first class and the 4D ones are amazing",Universal Studios Singapore

Nuno Pacheco,3.0,"August 10, 2019",Universal studios experience,"The park is not so big as you might expect in a place like Singapore. Go only if you really want to go to a park and have time for it. The attractions where I would spend most of the time would be Battlestar Galactica, Transformers: the 3D Ride and Revenge of the Mummy. I watched the Lights, Camera, Action and WaterWorld shows. You don't loose too much time in lines and they are nice but remember you are in a park. Be prepared to starve because the food is either really bad (worst than average when compared to other parks I've been) and at the end of a very long and slow line. Eat a good breakfast, grab a snack in the restaurants area just before entering the park and go. Inside drink water and fresh juices, eat fruit and return to the restaurants area outside the park at the end fo the day. You will have the company of a lot of people avoiding the extremely long line to take mono rail but you will be able to eat something. Believe me, even fast food will be appealing...",Universal Studios Singapore

There’s plenty of food and drinks throughout the park as well as great souvenirs to take back home, sure there’s going to be queuing that’s why it’s important to pick the right day but there not that long and if need be head of to something else and return later.",Universal Studios Singapore
Adeesh C,4.0,"August 8, 2019",Long wait trip,"It's a dream for many to visit the Universal studios in Singapore or USS as the locals call it. Unfortunately we got an opportunity to visit this modern marvel on a Sunday. A piece of advice, never ever visit this place on a weekend or a public holiday, it just gets insane. The cost of a regular ticket was approximately SGD 79 which included an SGD 5 food coupon. We tried our luck with a rollercoaster called Cyclone which had a 70 mins wait time. We waited in the queue for 50 mins which has no sitting facility and to our disappointment the ride was closed due to technical reasons. We then moved on to the transformers which again had 50 mins wait time. To our luck we experienced the thrill and our wait was worth. USS is divided into several portions like transformers, Egypt land, Jurassic Park, etc and you need to be a good walker to explore this place without getting tired. This place does serve Indian food however I would still recommend to try the Chinese or Malay food when in Singapore. If you wish to buy an souvenirs, they are the most expensive in here. To skip the Sunday crowd you may purchase an Express pass which is quite expensive.",Universal Studios Singapore

We got in early and did a couple of rides before the crowds built up, but after that the wait times were long and a bit unpredictable. Fast pass price on the day was 160 SGD! Could not justify that with family of 5. Mummy ride was good but couple of delays during the ride kind of spoiled the experience. Cylon ride was the best coaster. Food mediocre and expensive. In short, worth going with kids IMHO, but have the right expectations.",Universal Studios Singapore

Each section has its own gift shops and themed eateries but unless you really like the rides, or themed shops, there is little else in the actual park itself.

Pasi J,5.0,"August 7, 2019",Good fun made more enjoyable with Express Pass,"Universal theme parks are good fun; we’ve visited them on three continents so far. Although the ones in Orlando do go that extra mile as far as details are concerned, the Singapore theme park is very enjoyable with cool rides and cool setting. Personal favourites include Galactica rollercoasters – both fun in their own way – Transformers and The Mummy. The Waterworld stunt show was fun and, possibly not surprisingly, way more exciting than the movie it’s based on. And yes, you will get wet on the Jurassic rafts. We visited on a reasonably moderate day, not too crowded, but even then the Express Pass turned out to be a good choice. It’s reasonably pricey compared to the ordinary entrance ticket but if you come here from several time zones away you’d rather not spend the day waiting.",Universal Studios Singapore

mccrud,4.0,"August 6, 2019",Great family day out,We arrived about 9.30am and we were close to the front of the entrance queue for 10am opening. We had pre purchased tickets. The park is not very large but for the day it was large enough. Towards the afternoon the queues got very long wait times of 90 minutes plus. We left the park and got a return stamp. Later in the afternoon after 4.45 the queue times had went down and we went to the rides again. There is plenty of food restaurants but we found that they were expensive.,Universal Studios Singapore
FootstepsDK,1.0,"August 6, 2019",By all means AVOID this daylight robbery!,"Having been to Universal Studios Orlando, we thought it would be interesting to try the Singapore version of the theme park. However, with so few rides, we refused to shell out the 110 SGD they wanted for an Express Pass, as we thought it was a ripoff. The park is very small after all, and it doesn't have a lot of rides. So we chose to queue among the other commoners this time. Boy, what an ""experience"".  Here's the thing: When you're in the regular queue, the estimated waiting times aren't working. It varies with the amount of Express Pass holders attending the ride, so if a ride displays a waiting time of just 20 minutes, it might end up being 40-50 minutes anyway, if lots of Express Pass holders go there. When you pay extra for the Express Pass, you're always prioritized over the regular crowd, so when you're in the regular queue, you can do nothing but stand still and with the Express Pass holders walk right onto the ride.  Luckily there's not really anything else to do besides queuing, as there aren't a lot of things going on around the park. Unlike most Disney parks, Universal Studios parks seem to lack smaller activities and areas around the park, where you can walk around and enjoy the scenery, or take a break from doing rides.  The food is mediocre at best, and don't expect any smiles from the staff either. It's just an assembly line, and they can't wait to get rid of you. Only place we saw staff smiling, was in Starbucks, which is quite ironic.  Also, there's the pushing and shoving from all sides, which is common among people from certain countries. And when queuing for a ride, forget about having any personal space. You'll most likely have someone almost rubbing against you from behind, which is not the most pleasant thing, given the very hot and humid climate.  The rides are also disappointingly short, especially given the long waiting times.",Universal Studios Singapore
Anna L,1.0,"August 5, 2019","Horrible queues, poor customer service","The recent reviews are all true - so disappointing! If you have no choice but to visit this place, make sure you get an Express Pass (via Klook). It might be worth your time if you have this. We went on a Tuesday (not a public holiday) and the first couple of rides we took had us in the queue for around an hour or so! We had a 5 year old with us and with the temperature in SG, the queue was almost unbearable. We wanted to get an Express Pass after realizing our mistake of not getting one, but apparently, this will cost you an arm and leg if you buy in-house - 130 SGD EACH. We were 3 adults and 1 kid in our group. I couldn't bear swallowing down the cost so we persisted and still tried to line up and make do with our situation hoping that the other queues will be better. It did get better towards late afternoon/early evening before closing so there were shorter queues and our kid did enjoy several rides. We had an unfortunate experience though in one of the rides (Far Far Away: Puss In Boots’ Giant Journey). After we were in the queue for almost an hour and nearing the ride, a staff (local guy) came up to us and asked us how many we were - I answered ""we are 2+2"" while pointing to our group. He responded by raising his voice and saying ""what's 2+2?? I asked you how many you were!"" I was surprised by his tone and asked him what is wrong with him and then he just went off leaving us there – it seemed to me his shift was done. My son asked me what happened and I had to explain calmly that some people are not very smart and are rude. Anyway, this is just absolutely terrible customer service that you think you wouldn't have to deal with at this place. USS needs better queue management and better customer service training for their people. If you like theme parks and live in South East Asia, just go to Japan (Disney, Universal). Do not bother with this place if you can.",Universal Studios Singapore

I highly recommend to buy express ticket as the queue could be very long for each ride. Sentosa is a 25 mins drive from town which is ok.

Tara C,2.0,"August 4, 2019",A pretty disappointing day at USS,"To be completely honest, we left USS feeling pretty disappointed. For two of the rides with the longest waits (Mummy and Battlestar Galactica) we were informed - literally just as we got to the front of the line for both - that the rides were having technical glitches, and were recommended to leave the line “to enjoy the rest of the park”. We appreciate that safety must always come first - without doubt - but we just left feeling that we hadn’t really experienced the best of the park. Perhaps our opinion might’ve been different if we had shelled out for the (ridiculously expensive) express passes.",Universal Studios Singapore

Never have I been to a resort where we are fed up with rude, loud and pushy people all wanting to push queues and we were even express. Just no order to anything.  Don’t go on the battle star in Sifi land as even express doesn’t count for much. They take one to two people in express even sometimes none compared to 20 in normal queue. It’s like your being punished for having the privilege. And after an 1hour wait not worth it. 🙈.

The park is reasonably sized and has many restaurants and cafes. Normally four to five hours are enough to visit all attractions if the park is not crowded, however we experienced a crowded day were we had to buy the universal Express pass at a price of 60 SGD per person, and we we're lucky to ride most of the attractions.

A tip if you haven’t been on a roller coaster before: start on the small ones. we started on the Battlestar Galactica and got quite a shock. (Still really fun though).

When entering we could see how very busy it was and were sort of regretting not getting the express passes, but at $110 each and only being able to use them once per ride an extra $440 was way too much.  Now here is my top tip. When entering the park ignore the first big attraction- Transformers and head to attractions further away such as the rollercoasters. The lines there in the morning were on average 15 mins yet Transformers on entering was 80 mins. Then when you have been on all the rides at the back of the park, make your way back to those close to the entry in the afternoon. Yep you’ve guessed it the lines were now at 20 mins.  It appears most just head for the first attraction they see.",Universal Studios Singapore

The express pass was now $110 each. Apparently they use variable demand driven pricing. When busy it costs a lot more. Despite the cost, we bought them as you come to a place like this to have fun and not stand around in a queue in the heat. Great park and we all loved it.

jobaro149,3.0,"July 26, 2019",Good but a lot of waiting,"Great theme park. Like all theme parks, it’s overpriced and their website is honest when they warn visitors to expect to spend an average of four hours of the day waiting in queues. We went in low peak, weekday, non-school holiday time and still had to wait times of between 45 and 1 hour 40 mins for each ride. If you can afford it, purchase the unlimited express ticket. Each person will cost $90 (on top of the entry ticket price) if you buy it outside the park otherwise it’ll cost $140 once you’re inside the park.

Andrew W,3.0,"July 26, 2019",Only worth visiting with Express Pass,"We knew that the park is targeted at a younger age range (I’d say 5-12) the rides were all well themed and enjoyable.  However, if you aren’t prepared to buy express passes (which at least double the price) then be prepared to be pretty frustrated. On most of the rides then at least half of the carriages are filled from the express ‘queue’ - which effectively doubles the wait time for the standard queue (and hence the displayed wait time is basically a guess).  In parks in the US and Europe they limit the number of express passes issued to avoid this.  Everybody expects long queues but is apparent that USS are looking to gouge the customers which kind of took the edge off the day.",Universal Studios Singapore
Silvia S,2.0,"July 26, 2019","So disappointed! Run by kids, long queues, expensive and badly managed.","We were so looking forward to taking the kids to their first theme park but it was very disappointing. The queues are impossible (on what was supposed to be a low peak day) with 60-80 min waiting for rides. The staff seems mostly unhappy to be there and one of the toilets blocks I entered with the girls was so dirty. I'll await for a few years till the kids are older to ever go to a theme park again, as the only way for this day to have made sense would be with an EXPRESS pass (unless you like queuing 4h+ for 4 rides). There's very little entertainment when you walk around, they could have made it so much better for the people waiting. Think about it twice, not the greatest experience we were expecting. The rides for young kids are very disappointing, it might be best for teenagers.  The Shrek 4D show was the worst - the young girl introducing the show was so rude and then our chairs didnt work. After 1h wait. The best part of the day was the Elm's TV show - run by great performers, and a great show overall.",Universal Studios Singapore

We came before 11 am and it was a long queue before we could enter the main gate. A lot of rides, shows and activities there. The problem was that it was so hot at that time and we have to line up at least 1.5 hours to joint one activity. I was with my 2 kids, eleven n five years old. We thought that it was not going to be that crowded since we checked that time was not a school holiday for Singaporean, but we we wrong, a lot of tourists came at that time. I would suggest for us who have young kids, to buy express ticket during the peak season. And don’t forget to bring umbrella, the weather was about 34 -35 degree Celsius.",Universal Studios Singapore

Once inside, we went straight to Battlestar Galactica ride. Wait time was 15 minutes. We put our things in the free 45 minute locker and waited in line. And waited. 60 minutes later we rode the ride which was awesome. After the ride we had to pay for the locker. After a long discussion with the attendant, we and a few other riders got the locker opened for free. We then did Transformers which was already at a 45 minute wait. We waited just over an hour. Fantastic ride. Jurassic Park river rapids was next which was a huge favourite. And we waited again over an hour despite the time saying a 30 minute wait. Lastly we rode the Mummy and once again despite a 40 minute wait, we waited over 80 minutes. The mummy was my favourite ride of the day. Despite the rides being great, we were very frustrated by the discrepancies in wait times and how long we had to wait. Each ride was at least 20 minutes longer than we were told. More communication from staff would have been nice.",Universal Studios Singapore

FWX,3.0,"July 22, 2019","Interesting, but will not return","First time to USS because it was a company family event so I didn't have to pay over $75 for the admission. The reason why I haven't visited is very much because of the costly admission and hearing that waiting in queues is a norm there.  Regardless, it was an interesting experience. Did two of the more highly recommended rides amongst others - Transformer and Mummy. Mummy was exciting while Transformer was fascinating in that it piqued in my interest in how it felt like we were moving in the same space but not. Minimal queue (about 20 mins) because it was a closed door event. Would I join the queue again? Not really.  Enjoyed the Elmo show as well and really liked the energy levels. I liked the professionalism of the mascots in USS as well. It must have been real warm in there, but the crew gave their best to dance and entertain the visitors.  Glad that I finally had a chance to visit after so many years but would not visit again as the place is rather small and we managed to cover pretty much whatever we wanted to in the whole place.",Universal Studios Singapore
m2b,4.0,"July 22, 2019",One for the kids,"I visited with my wife for an afternoon and really enjoyed a number of the rides. I would highly recommend getting the after hours tickets on a Friday or Saturday as when we went there were virtually no ride queues for the big more 'adult' attractions, although as the national day rehearsals were going on in the city centre this may have accounted for the lower visitor numbers. Food was easily available if not a little pricey (but I guess Singapore is a little pricey anyhow) and it is more aimed at families and would be a great day out for young kids. That being said it was worthwhile for a 3-4 hour visit as some of the rides were great especially the 'Cylon'.",Universal Studios Singapore

mkerner2018,3.0,"July 22, 2019",Good but only with an express pass,We enjoyed the park and it was as we expected. We were advised by several taxi drivers that we shouldn’t visit on a weekend because it’s busy then with locals as well as tourists so we went on a Friday. It was still crazy busy with ques between 60-80 mins so in the end we had to get the express pass otherwise we would have run out of time to do everything it’s also too hot to stand in ques they have fans and water fountains in the ques but with children it’s just too much so I would definitely advise an express pass..worth the money. Favourite were the transformers 3D ride as my daughter said “its awesome!” The waterworld show brilliantly done and a good opportunity to cool down if you sit in the wet zone at the front. We also enjoyed the mummy and the puss in boots ride. Jurassic Park rapids were fun too. Although the Madagascar ride was a bit of a let down quite boring for the que time. There are lots of water refil points so to save some money for all the things the kids are bound to want take bottles for water refills.,Universal Studios Singapore
tripexpedia,2.0,"July 21, 2019",Wrip off in peak season,The waiting time for most attractions was 80 minutes!

Marie11M,5.0,"July 20, 2019",We had so much fun!,"We visited here a couple of days ago and had lots of fun. It was quite busy so we bought the fast pass (was cheaper to buy online way in advance as they put the price up the more people purchase tickets).  If you have ever been to the LA Universal there is a real difference between the two. Singapore is more about the rides than the behind the scenes, understandably. I’m glad this one has less 3D and 4D rides as they make me motion sick.  Souvenir shops were not as good as LA and the park didn’t have any Simpsons or Harry Potter attractions like LA.  Overall a great day and fast pass was worth it for us on the day so we didn’t have to wait 60 minutes in a line. Definitely get there at opening time to make the most of your day.",Universal Studios Singapore

drjb71,2.0,"July 19, 2019","Overcrowded, don't bother without an express pass","After reading some negative reviews, really didn’t want to go, but had promised the kids so had to go through with it. All the worst expectations were unfortunately fulfilled - the overcrowding was ridiculous. The cost to us as a family of 6 was $420, (children over 12 are considered adults, and there are no family tickets) and adding the recommended express passes to this was going to bring the total to $720, just not in the budget given the other activities we were doing over the week. On the credit side, getting there is far easier than the zoo - catch the purple MRT line to HarbourFront, and you can from there walk to Sentosa for free over the boardwalk causeway - the best part of a km but aided by travelators. There is also the cable car (scenic but pricey) and the monorail. Unfortunately, the crowds started immediately - even though we were there at 9:20, the line was already over 50m long. The pre booked tickets through Klook worked well however(scanning a phone barcode) so the line moved fairly quickly. Definitely do not buy tickets at the gate, as this will take much longer. Once inside, got on the mummy ride very quickly, then the waited for 30mins to get on the Jurassic park rapids. After this though it was chaos - the crowds had swelled dramatically and even the lame kiddy rides like the Madagascar boat ride had waits of around 50 mins. Had to wait over 70 mins to get on the (admittedly very good) Battlestar Galactica Cylon roller coaster, while fighting evil thoughts toward the express pass holders who were waltzing past on the left the whole time. After finally doing this ride, the crowds resembled LAX at rush hour, with lines even to buy overpriced food and drink. The kids were exhausted at this point so we left very disappointed. It would seem that express pass holders got onto the rides quite quickly, so if paying $130 pp is within your budget, more power to you. That said, many of the rides were quite meh compared to those at Disney or even Australia’s Gold Coast theme parks. The aforementioned Madagascar ride (an animatronic dark boat ride) has a very tight bar holding the rider in the seat, suggesting a Splash Mountain-esque payoff at the end - but there was absolutely no thrill whatsoever. In summary, do this if you can justify the expense of an express pass, but expect insane crowds (no joy in the heat and humidity) and rides that are for the most part average by world standards. Would NOT recommend without an express pass.",Universal Studios Singapore
kimandco_11,4.0,"July 19, 2019",Hot and Sticky & heaps of Fun,"We love universal Studios anywhere and Sentosa was no different, it was very warm and very busy, get there right on opening and get to the most popular rides, as it goes from a 20 minute wait to a 60-80 minute wait very quickly. We had two of the rides have technical issues which was a pain - The Transformer ride was really great, and walk in keeps you and the kids entertained waiting, this was broken down when we first tried to get in, then we went to The Mummy ride, which had broken down earlier in the day and broke down again while we where in there, we were considering leaving after 40 minutes but they got things back online. The Humans and Cylones rollercoasters were good, although I did feel a bit unwell after the cyclone ride as it was a hanging rollercoaster and we went upside down a couple of times. Not a heap of food options in there for me, as Im Gluten free but the whole of Singapore was like this, they really didn't have any idea how to cater for Gluten Free. Drink a lot of water and wear a hat, the heat will get to you very quickly. The bus from Singapore to Sentosa only costs $1 and is free once you are on Sentosa Island. You can travel to several places once on Sentosa, have a good look around. When you are in Resort World (Universal Studios, SEA Aquarium etc it isn't easy to fund your way out). Make your way downstairs for a bus. No information areas we found, so gather your information before you get there.",Universal Studios Singapore

And i asked if it can be mixed - he replied with a NO! But it was too salty for kids! Transferd to another cashier and ask for the same thing and she eventually obliged. Queue for Waterworld is horrible!!! Very dangerous and it can cause stampede!!! Why do they not arrange for a queue line barricades to manage the crowd? So be very careful when visiting!

jess b,4.0,"July 17, 2019",Thrilling day out,"Universal studios was great, lots of thrilling rides. I ended up buying an express pass as some of the queues were up to 2hours long. It was worth the extra money even though it was very expensive. It was very busy in the morning and mid afternoon, but towards later afternoon there were shorter wait times. The shows were great as well. My criticism would be when I arrived just after opening time lots of the rides were still closed, in my first hour I was only able to find 1 ride which was open. This really needs to be sorted out, it’s not fair to expect people to pay the expensive prices and not have rides open on time. Also there was another ride (Canopy Flyer) which had a single rider entry, 3 times I got turned away from this ride saying we’re not doing single rider at the moment come back later. I eventually decided to join the normal queue and was very annoyed to find out that staff started letting single riders through and as a result people got on the ride before me. Overall I had a great day and I hope on my next visit to universal Singapore that these 2 issues have been sorted out.",Universal Studios Singapore
CMillen80,2.0,"July 17, 2019",Terrible Value for Money (Unsurprisingly!),"Well, our visit to Universal Studios Singapore was not what I’d call great! Having spent about $80/head for tickets, we thought, although it’s a fair amount of money, at least it’s unlimited rides. Also it wasn’t a weekend or school holidays, so thoughts were the crowd would be less.  Although this was true, we absolutely underestimated how long the queues are, and also the inequality between the ‘have’s’ and the ‘have nots!’. And by that I mean those with ‘Express Lane’ passes and those without. I’m not sure what other theme parks are like, but we (the have nots) lined up with the vast majority for 60min for a rollercoaster, while the Express Lane holders swept through their own queue to each ride, passing the rest of us. They do pay for the privilege, which I worked out to be roughly $210/person including entry, which is an outrageous price.  They really should only have a single flat rate of entry, to ensure fairness, even if that is more than the $80 we paid. Ultimately without the rides, the place isn’t really worth visiting, and waiting 60min for the popular ones also makes it not worth visiting!  My first suggestion would be don’t go! My second would be that if you must go, get the express pass if you can afford to stump up the money!",Universal Studios Singapore

I ran straight to the Battlestar duelling coasters and managed to beat the queue (and the ride was great).

Bailey T,4.0,"July 16, 2019",So much fun!,"I was on the fence about buying tickets because of the reviews on here, but in the end I'm really glad we decided to go! There are lots of complaints about long lines, but I think if you strategize your visit, you can avoid the worst of the queues. I've been to Universal Studios in Florida, which is far larger and, to be honest, better, but I still had a blast here. We came on a week day and arrived right as the park opened - always the best strategy. The park is so small that you can walk around the whole thing in about 10 minutes, but that just means you can more easily get to the rides you want to visit.  Assuming you're not visiting with young kids, I would recommend doing rides like the Mummy and Lost World early in the day. See a show, have lunch (speaking of which, if you book on the Universal website, you can get a ticket with $5 meal voucher for cheaper than the cost of a single ticket), and then go for the less ""thrilling"" rides like the Shrek theatre, Spielberg experience, Puss in Boots ride, etc. Then, once 3-4 p.m. hits, there are pretty much no lines for the Transformers and BattleStar Galactica roller coasters!  Food is actually reasonably priced if you want to eat lunch here (and remember that meal voucher deal I mentioned!), and there are also lots of restaurants in the surrounding resort area outside the park where you can eat for probably even cheaper if you get a re-entry sticker.  We had an amazing time here - don't pass it up just because you're anxious about the long lines!",Universal Studios Singapore

Mjl221065,1.0,"July 16, 2019","Hmm, please be aware.","Went to Universal Studios with 2 teenage daughters, all of us love the big rides, headed straight for the Transformers Human ride, we were warned there was an 80 minute queue, however on entry they take everything off you, ie loose change, wallets, mobile phone ... and bottles of water, they then get you to queue in an area which has very poor a/c and then you wait and wait and wait ... whilst all the Express tickets holders get on the ride, one group of lads went on 3x times whilst we were queuing, after 90 mins we make the stair case up to the ride no a/c at all and thus is where people began to faint including one of my party. We had to leave the queue, fortunately after a visit to the first aid she was ok, however we did then ask for our money back as I really font believe it was safe for people to be expected to endure conditions such as that. In the parks defence the manager in the Guest Services was very professional and managed the situation very well.

Nat McAsey,3.0,"July 16, 2019",Wouldn’t bother,Honestly I just wouldn’t bother coming here unless you have a high tolerance for waiting in lines and the patience of a saint. We went on a Thursday and it was just chaos from getting in to going through Universal itself. It was magical when you first walk in and the few rides we did go on were fun but I HIGHLY recommend paying for the express pass because most rides were 40-80 minute wait each. We found Universal obscenely expensive once inside however Singapore in general we found very expensive. I.e a bottle of coke in a cool glass with straw was like $17 each. I’d probably also recommend going around 2-3pm as everyone was there when it opened and it was chaos but when we left at around 2.30pm no one was qeueing at all. If you’re only in Singapore for a few days there are a lot more things you can do than Universal in my opinion. Props to the water show though that was very cool and well done.,Universal Studios Singapore
Jeremy W,5.0,"July 15, 2019",Adult fun!,"Visited with my wife while on holiday in Singapore. My tip would be buy an express pass if visiting Universal Studios on the weekend. Costs $110/adult additional to ticket but cut waiting time from 90->15 mins on some rides the day we went. Valid for 1 ride on approx 15 rides (excludes maybe 3 rides where not available). Prepare to get wet feet on the Jurassic Park ride which could make the rest of the day unpleasant, if not prepared! Roller coasters were awesome and enjoyed Waterworld show which we had seen in Hollywood also. Eat before going as food is expensive and it’s hot in there. We got a combo ticket that includes gondola each way, Universal Studios entry and Aquarium entry. It was nice going back home on the Gondola at night also.",Universal Studios Singapore

Tip: if you not want to queue for a long time, better you pay for the extra like Universal Express just like what we did. No long queue and you are priority.",Universal Studios Singapore
Stuart B,4.0,"July 12, 2019",Makes you feel 16 again.,"Overall a really nice day. But a few things let it down. Very crowded & very hot the day we went. Pleased we paid extra for the Universal Express pass, some rides were stating 75 & 85 minutes wait. But with the priority pass - straight to the front. We tried most of the rides. But chickened out on the 2 roller coasters. Lots of cold drinks and eateries everywhere and plenty of places to sit and relax for a while before catching the next event or attraction. Very kids orientated, as is the American ones but a fun day out all the same even for big kids.",Universal Studios Singapore

topdeck73,4.0,"July 10, 2019","A good day out, but big queues","We weren’t going to bother with Universal studios when we went to Sentosa island, however the sight of the castle did build the excitement, and needless to say we decided this is where we would spend the day. Tickets are very pricy considering it’s not a massive park, but we had a great day out.  We were there for opening, and literally went on every ride we walked past to beat the queues. However by the time we got half way around we had to succumb to waiting in lines. We waited over an hour for the River Rapids ride which was lots of fun, but that was the last ride I was prepared to wait like that for. Universal studios is very popular so it would likely be like this every day. The skip the queues Pass was expensive and quite frankly, there was still a wait to go on rides. We found the best thing to do was to separate and my husband went on rides as a single rider. You can beat an hour long queue using this trick, getting on the ride within 10 minutes in some cases.  Many rides are for younger riders, but that was fine for us. Food wasn’t over the top expensive, but again lots of people means lots of waiting.",Universal Studios Singapore

johnnoshungry,3.0,"July 10, 2019",Jurys out on this one.,"Unfortunately we struck a day that was affected by inclement weather and a breakdown of the main roller coaster just as we were about to get on it after a 40 minute wait. It was hot,humid, uncomfortable and then the thunder and lightning started followed by a tropical downpour which we were caught in. Again, all happening after we endured a 30 minute wait to the stunt demonstration which also was cancelled. All in all not an enjoyable day but can’t entirely be blamed on the park. It is a fairly small park especially compared to Paris Disneyland which is the only other park I have been to which is similar ;and is easily covered. Queues however can blow out to an hours wait or more at peak. Priority queue tickets can be purchased for $140/ head. A lot of the rides and events are especially aimed at young children more so than teenagers. Loved the New York street setting as well as the Spielberg lights, camera, action hurricane recreation. Food available on site but very expensive of course. Can catch the MRT from the other side of the causeway at Harbourfront which conveniently houses a shopping mall and many fine restaurants on the river front .",Universal Studios Singapore

shadur,3.0,"July 7, 2019",Nah,When you have been to the parks in America then come here it's quite a let down.i guess it would be a good entrance park for a family with young kids to get the taste for the rides but I wanted excitement and didn't get it .mummy was good so was transformers but did leave me a bit nautious. As I am quite big I couldn't fit my shoulders and chest into the human or cyclone rides yet I had no problem at the same ride in qld Aus. On the day we visited 6/7 the park closed unannounced at 6pm and left us very time poor so see the whole park.a express pass is a must here as it is very busy and every ride has 1 hour line up which eats into your day very quickly.wpuldnt recommend this one.,Universal Studios Singapore
Theresa C,4.0,"July 7, 2019",Fun for the Family,"We went on a weekday when it is supposed to be less crowded. Average wait time for rides/shows was between 10-30 min. But we waited 80 minutes for the Jurassic Park Rapids Adventure (great ride but not worth the wait!). An hour into the wait, staff announced they were adding more rafts to the ride to lessen wait time. Don’t know why they waited so long to do that! Rather than wait in that line, try to catch the Transformers ride and the Lights, Camera, Action show. Universal closes at 8 p.m., a couple hours earlier than other parks we have been to, so plan your day and skip really long lines to take in as much shows and rides. Some other tips: buy tickets in advance to avoid long lines and quicker entrance (we used Klook and saved some $); bring extra clothes (we got soaked in one ride); bring bottled water (lots of it - it’s humid and drinks are pricey); bring snacks (again food is very pricey, even for a sandwich); bring a portable fan, sold at Chinatown and other tourist shops; and finally, as you leave Universal, stop by Garrett’s popcorn - a delicious snack to end the day!",Universal Studios Singapore

Bluey,1.0,"July 5, 2019",Poor Service and Exorbitant Price with No Service,"Yes if you’re all paid up for an annual pass it’s great, better if you’re also a Express Pass annual pass holder. It’s not right if you’re buying an express pass but all rides are not eligible (Jurassic Park).  Now waiting 50 minutes is acceptable if you’re informed but not in congested places where in my opinion safety was an issue in an event of something going wrong.  Staff are commercially motivated, which is understandable but a great customer experience delivers a long term sustainable business, I speak from experience and for a corporate event will not have this venue on my list.  Socially speaking it’s not worth the effort even personally and this is not good for your establishment.  Disappointing...I think Singapore has more to offer. Try the Night Safari, the Zoo, the Museum or even a walk on Orchard Road it’s going to be a better value for you tome and money.  You won’t give money back, don’t expect it but please be mire hospitable and to visitors be more understanding...it’s a entertainment business not a cultural event.  Annual Pass was a waste, express rides should be included and I do request this for everyone. Please let people know what they get...I know what you don’t the hard way.

Suggestions - take your own food & drinks to keep expenses down. We didn't know about the - Priority tickets that let you on the rides faster & I didn't find out the price but if you had limited time there it would be worth it. We waited for One hour & 20 mins for one ride and the other rides from 30 mins to 55 mins. Don't trust the wait time signs at the entry to each ride, 15 min wait sign was actually at 40 min wait. Suggestion- go on the rides late in the evening after the Street Parade because there was very limited wait times, so we ran from one ride to another. The 10 pm firework are worth the wait but a long waiting for a taxi to get home. We went during the week & I suggest you avoid the weekends.",Universal Studios Singapore

Never queue more than 10 minutes. Instead move to a different ride where the express pass gets you in quickly. I am always amazed that people are actually prepared to queue for over an hour for what is a 2 minute ride. 4) after doing about 8 rides, call it a day around 2.30pm and catch the Sentosa express over to vivo city to get a bite to eat that's better and cheaper than the food at Universal.

Staff members just not interested and just counting down the hours till they can go home. No atmosphere, no fun vibe.  Food was hugely overpriced and not nice. I know what prices to expect, but Disney was a better experience all round.  Extra charges everywhere, gone are the days where you can put a 1 pound coin in a locker and then get it back. The lockers are computerised and charge hourly. I wanted to keep my camera safe from getting wet on the water ride, so thought 1 hour would be enough, only to find the queue was one hour alone, so had to increase it to 2 hours. Not cheap.  Get wet on a ride? The dryers cost extra, everything is extra. It becomes tiring paying again and again.  So why 2 stars? Because there is 1 thing that saved our entire trip.... Waterworld. Finally some atmosphere, laughs, amazing staff members on the show. Sadly the staff in charge of the queue to enter didn't say a single word and just stared at their phones. 0 interest.

TravellingSoul,3.0,"July 3, 2019",Did not match my expectations,"I had heard a lot about Universal Studios Singapore, so decided to visit this place on my recent Singapore holiday. We were a group of 4 and visited this place on a weekday, having got a lot of advice on not going on weekend as it gets too crowded. We went on a Thursday, reached around 11am. To be honest, the first impression was that it is really small. I have been to Disneyland Paris and Universal was nothing compared to that. The park has 7 themed zones but each has only 2 rides at max. The only zone with more than 4 rides was the Jurassic park. The park has 2 roller coasters in Sci-fi (Humans and Cyclone), 1 in Ancient Egypt and rest are kiddie rides mostly. Transformers in the Sci-fi Zone is a must do. Tickets on the official website priced around INR 4200 per person. But we booked on Klook for INR 3500. Klook has amazing offers for most activities so do check prices here before booking anything. June being school holidays in Singapore it was still pretty crowded but if you visit on a weekday in any other month, it should be a breeze. The Express Pass was a total waste of 40$, as the park has limited rides to justify that cost, over and above the entry ticket cost. A good hack is to try Singles line. The Jurassic Park Rapids Adventure, had a 100 min waiting time, but all 4 of us were in the ride within next 10 mins through the Singles Lane. Also, the food is really overpriced (and not so good either) so make sure to pack some dry snacks for the day",Universal Studios Singapore

ArabianPrincessQatar,1.0,"July 1, 2019","Hot, expensive, dreadful","If you love queuing cumulatively for 5hrs with 2 small children to ride for 30 mins total then this is definitely the place for you!  If not, then save your holiday, your money, your family's time and go somewhere else.  Honestly this was one of the worst paid for 'experiences' we've ever had anywhere in the world. 1.5hrs of queuing for a ride which said it was a 45 min wait at the start. The ride took 7.5 mins. Another one was a 45min wait for a 35 sec ride. Hot, stinky, crowded queues.  Two of the family rides weren't even working when the park opened because of what the staff said were technical problems.  The kicker is when you do decide to pay the extra 70SGD pp for an 'Express' ticket to jump the queue, they then use surge pricing and say it will cost 140SGD pp (no discount for kids). Even those with Express tickets had to wait 45mins to ride the Jurassic Park Rapids when the average ticket holder had to wait 2hrs.  In the midst of this self-punishment I tried to get a beer. Waited in line for 5 mins to get to the front only to be told the 11SGD beer had sold out. I guess there were other desperate adults who'd got there quicker.  As well as that when the kids wanted photos with the characters they were told no, only photos taken by professional photographers.

There are a few roller coasters 2 of which are good, the others are not so good. The best 2 rides are the Transformers and the mummy ride. I really think the operators here need to go to Universal Studios in LA and see how they operate, there is no comparison between the 2. Very long line wait times with lots of people very hot and sweaty and very smelly Body Odour, the park operators need to invest in some air conditioning for the queues. I only saw 2 theme park characters Woody Wood Pecker and the Egyptian warlords. I do not think it’s a worthwhile visit here. The kids had a good time but for adults waiting around for them whilst on rides there needs to be something to keep them happy as well.

It was the right decision as the length of the quoue was shorten by about 3 to 5 times averagely depending on the type of the rides. We tried everything the children were allowed (they were around 120 cm height). We adults like the revenge of the mummy most, while kids preferred the Enchanted airways and puss in boots giant. Some attractions were temporary closed for some hours during lunch time. They said that it's all due to technical problems but ad it's all shutted down around lunch time, I wasn't so sure if it was just for staff lunch break or something. Food is expensive as expected. In general, it was a great fun for all of us.",Universal Studios Singapore
Ana,2.0,"June 30, 2019",The Smallest in the World!,"Ii am happy to see such an attraction in Singapore and it is well maintained. However, it is indeed over priced tickets. the VIP pass is useless when it is handled by poorly managed organization. Super small studio. Some of the lockers are free for the first 45 min. You can enjoy everything in less than 4 hours. Lots of restaurants and casino outside studio.",Universal Studios Singapore
himani d,5.0,"June 30, 2019",Love the Day at Universal Studios,"I went last year in July.. You have to spare 1 full day for the Universal Studios. If you are going during holidays then prefer to take Express Card to save your time from long queues. It was the one of the best places to spend time there and if you visit Singapore then Universal Studio should be your on Travel list.  As I like many rides there but my favorite was ""Transformers The Ride 3D"", amazing ride which I have never done in India. I had done this ride twice. Also if you want to go for Rollercoasters then try Battlestar Galactica an amazing ride but go for this ride at last.  The Jurassic Park Adventure is also a must show where you will find Stunt Show.which is constructed theater where performers play role.  The whole day was worth spending for entire family. And one thing take passport with you so you can go to Casino on entrance of Universal Studio, the entry is at basement. Worth Visit.",Universal Studios Singapore

Aditya Mittal,5.0,"June 29, 2019",Fantastic experience with kids,"Amazing experience, must do with kids. Please do not club with any other activity (e.g. Sentosa fun pass etc.). Spend the whole day only at the Universal Studio, do all the rides, watch all the shows and enjoy. Reach before noon and return at night to experience daytime and night time views. To maximize the fun part, no rushing - do all activities at a leisurely pace. The only drawback is that food is very expensive. Must carry your own water bottle(s).",Universal Studios Singapore

We took the Express pass (I cannot recommend it enough, you MUST get it!) and were able to get on all the rides we wanted. My top ones are: 1. Transformers 2. Water World (the show) 3. Jurassic Park  We did the Madagascar and Shrek ones as well but they were not that fun, waste of time really. BSG looked too scary so we avoided it.  Overall, it was lots of fun, just a shame they charge you for some lockers (annoying) and that food/drinking is stupidly expensive (11$ for a slice of pizza!)",Universal Studios Singapore
Jodie N,4.0,"June 27, 2019","Typical USS experience , tips to enjoy your day","This review is not so much about what is at universal but rather how to get the most out of your day and make it enjoyable so hope it helps others . Hints : avoid Friday - Monday if you can , that’s when it’s busiest . Be there when gates open at 10 am and go directly to the busiest rides most popular rides , don’t dawdle ( transformers , mummy , Jurassic park for older kids) by 11am the park is extremely busy and starting to peak . Take a water bottle , there are watercoolers in some wait line areas and scattered around park and taps in restrooms , otherwise drinks are expensive . If you are not sure about buying express passes and cost , wait until you get there to buy them , see what the crowds are like , the day we went we didn’t need them but we followed our own tips ! You can get a pass out , try to avoid riding amusements in peak time 11 am - 1630 hrs , do the shows , go to lunch outside the park , or back to hotel if close . By 1700 the lines will have subsided and waiting will be much more reasonable . Make sure you get a show timetable on admission and plan what you are watching and which characters you want to meet and greet . Travel as lightly as you can , don’t take a huge bag it’s just cumbersome to offload fir rides etc. Check out options of riding as a single if lines are long often this can make the process quicker . You may get wet on the Jurassic jungle ride , factor this into your day Enjoy and pace the kids so they don’t get too tired !",Universal Studios Singapore

Rhsethi,3.0,"June 27, 2019",Thumbs Up!!,"We had an excellent time at USS. The kids loved it and adults alike. We chose a weekday purely to avoid the rush and we were pleasantly surprised to get an entry in Transformer (twice) very easily. One day is not sufficient to give justice to all the rides and shows. You need 2 days for sure. It was bit smaller compared to the one in US (LA) but good for this part of the earth.  Following were turn offs: * Food and Beverages were criminally expensive. * Water coolers were dispensing warm water, another smart move to push people towards purchasing coke or bottled water. Clever marketing tricks. 3 stars for purely these turn-offs * The staff at all the rides were very cold with everyone. However the staff in blue tshirts and khaki trousers were good.",Universal Studios Singapore
Thaplayer1209,4.0,"June 27, 2019","Excellent, exciting, exhilarating","The different themes of the places adds freshness to each section of the theme park, so similar rides have a totally different experience. The variety of rides fit the theme and are fun and exciting in their own ways. They range from the child-friendly tram rides to more extreme rollercoasters. The restaurants and stalls also fit with the theme by the aesthetic and serving style. However, the variety of food is the same throughout the restaurants, the food is also somewhat overpriced. Overall, the experience is worth it.",Universal Studios Singapore

Gabrielle B,3.0,"June 26, 2019",Overpriced and nothing like Universal LA,"If you have been to universal studios in LA or Florida, this one is a real let down. Extremely overpriced at $79 Singapore dollars. Queues for most adult rides are on average 55 mins which means you are standing around a lot of the time. You can upgrade to an express pass, but this is an extra $60. Way too expensive. The 2 roller coaster rides, human and cylon were great, it again, over an hour wait for each ride. Revenge if the mummy and transfers ride were also good. The Jurassic park rapids was closed for a couple of hours due to technical issues. Had lunch at Mels dine in and the food was awful. $15 for either a beef or chicken burger and our party of 4 all agreed that they were the foulest burgers we had ever eaten. Expected it to be at least similar in quality and taste to the other universal parks, but definitely is not. Very overpriced in regard to food, merchandise and drinks. Would give it a miss unless you like to over pay and wait for rides",Universal Studios Singapore

Before disconnecting, they said I need to call Viator to request a refund.  I am not absolutely vivid - while on my honeymoon no less!

Most of the shows were either at about 10:30-11am and then later about 4pm however this does change day to day and they hand out the times upon entering. We didn't buy a fast pass, many people did, we think with smaller children we may have used it a couple of times, however we just used the wait time boards to check the wait time and choose the ride with the least time, the longest time we waited was about 20mins.

It took us all day to do all the rides once and if we hadn’t bought the express passes we would of spent our day queuing in lines and would have never got to do all the rides!

During my visit (Monday, June 17th), The transformers ride wait time was about an hour. Since the open time was from 10 am - 7 pm, There was not enough time to complete all rides due to the long wait time for each rides.

Pink Lys,4.0,"June 19, 2019",Good place to enjoy your day in Singapore,"The USS is very famous for its design, shows, movie characters performance and exciting roller coaster. When entering the park, remember to collect the map and show schedule at the stands next to the turnstile. Spend some time to take photos with the funny characters at the Hollywood Boulevard. If you love the high speed and risky games, let’s start from the right hand with high speed roller coaster at Sci-fi area and Ancient Egypt. If you go with young children, then let’s start from your left hand side. There are a lot of show, performance and photo shooting during the day at the park, but I’d recommend you check the slot and spend some time for the Water world show, in which the actors perform a fighting between heroes and pirates, with lots of action scene. Take notice for the seats, as you may get wet during the show, so have a look and choose the right seat if you don’t want to get wet. Photo shooting with the robots at the Transformer is also a recommendation, you should stand at the right side, to queue in 1st place when they start the shooting.",Universal Studios Singapore

girliemariejoyc... s,5.0,"June 19, 2019",Living a life of adventures!,"Best place if you want to have some fun! Arrive early before it opens so you could still take photos of the Universal Studios globe just outside with very few people. Express pass is very helpful if you want to experience literally everything. It would be nice to organize the attractions or activities that you want to do to be efficient with your time. I travelled with my sister and we definitely enjoyed our entire day in USS and we could say that we experienced every bit of it. The highlights that we could recommend are: (in no particular order) -Transformers -Battlestar Galactica -Waterworld -Lights, Camera, Action -Shrek 4D Adventure -Jurassic Park Rides Rapid Adventure -Canopy Flyer -Revenge of the Mummy -Meet and Greet with Minions and Transformers  It's best to bring your own ponchos, which you can both use for Waterworld and Jurassic Park Ride as in USS it cost I think SGD5. I bought mine for just a pound here in London, and we used it quite well.  There are a lot of food options everywhere. If you would like all those souvenirs, I suggest you do all the shopping in stores and photo taking after you've done all your activities as they won't close until about 8pm anyway.

Case93,3.0,"June 18, 2019","hmmm, it was a day out, fun in parts.","what can I say. was looking forward to this the most in Singapore, and made sure we rested up well to walk for a long time today around the park. easy to get to in a grab with little shops around to look in before going into the park. tickets were usual price you would expect to pay, 70-80$. we upgraded to express pass (1 ride per attraction) for 50$ or you can do 80$ for unlimited shots at the rides. agree with a previous comment - even though you're in the express line, people push past you straight to the front saying 'express, express' even though we're all in the same, express line. also strangely, we were in express line with lots of other people, had to get the ticket scanned in to get in the line yet the young lady at the Jurassic world ride picked us out of the line and asked to see our tickets? no one else, just us, strange.. staff hardly smile and aren't very helpful at all, just sign your card and that's it no commentary or telling you where to go. transformers is totally unnecessarily jolty, I was 1 second from puking in the ride just from the throwing around. shrek land was great and fun. sesame street a bit lame. other zones were very short lived, walk along and you're in the next zone already. return of the mummy was great, not really for kids. partner liked the rollercoasters but really only a couple that weren't for kids. perhaps some more adult ones would be good. Louis's pizza place was 11$ for one slice of pizza. pretty nuts. lots of water fountains around the park thankfully. we spent 3 hours max here, bit of fun but wouldn't come back and it's a super expensive day for families. would recommend going to the American studios. would attach pictures but I didn't actually take any.",Universal Studios Singapore
Jana L,1.0,"June 17, 2019",Overpriced and overrated,"We arrived around lunch time and opted for the unlimited express package. After all, everyone raves on how ""amazing!"" Universal Singapore is. So the extra 100 bucks on top of the 79 already charged for entry seemed worth it. Well it's actually a bit of hit and miss. You will find inside 4 ok thrill rides. The 2 battle star roller coasters, bumblebee transformers ride and and the Return of the Mummy ride. All the other maybe 5 rides are for kids and not very exciting. The benefits of the unlimited Express pass is you won't have to wait in long ques (although some rides we still waited 20 min as alot of people get the express pass and are very ""entitled"" about it, and will push and yell at you in broken english how they have express pass). But believe me, you won't want to get unlimited as the rides are not do thrilling you want to go more than once. If you get the regular 70 dollar ticket, expect to wait at least 40 min per ride and up to 2 hours.  Lastly I will say alot of tourist who visit Singapore, and yes I know this is cultural, do not wear deodorant. So the smell is horrendous and takes away any joy you might have from the rides. Even the the people operating the ride can be seen pinching their noses shut as the smell is awful. Save your money, go to dream world and movie world on the Gold Coast Australia instead.",Universal Studios Singapore

This means that by just taking a popular ride, you will need to wait 1.5hrs and pay an additional 6 dollars. This is ridiculous.  The service staff was also atrocious. The ""bouncers"" were talking rudely to any visitors who asked questions. They also rudely tell people to leave the queue after having waited 90mins. This happened to the couple in front of us. The ""service"" was worse than what you would get from a fast food chain. Seriously expected more than USS. Been to every major theme park in Asia and have never seen such thrash service. I think the service level here is an embarrassment to Singapore.  Hope some higher up can address the appalling level of service in USS.",Universal Studios Singapore
ACM1028,5.0,"June 14, 2019",Smaller Universal Studios,"As previously mentioned, it is smaller to their Japan and US counterpart. But still enjoyable. Get the express pass even on weekdays if you are not so much into waiting like me. But if you have patience, do not the express pass as the waiting is not that long. It varies from just 5 to 45 minutes with no express pass. So the choice is yours. I purchased our tickets at Klook which is cheaper compared to the site. The only drawback is, the purchase is non refundable so you just have to pray that there will not be any problem with the weather or you flight.",Universal Studios Singapore
The Dodgy Traveller,3.0,"June 14, 2019",Don't go on school holidays,We spent more time in the queues then on the actual rides. We found Water World to be the best attraction in the park. Bring your own food if you can.,Universal Studios Singapore

Vikas Goyal,5.0,"June 13, 2019",Exceptional experience,Universal studios are the best theme park i have visited till date and it revisited me too to the era when we used to run to cover all atractions and maxximum times . Proper reference needs to be taken from map and activity sheet to cover all zones extra activity . And to avoid waitings one should start in anti clock wise direction,Universal Studios Singapore
5_Chan,4.0,"June 13, 2019",Some options at RWS,"A recommended attraction if you are visiting RWS with young ones. While options may be limited for really young kids, there are some photo opportunities with the cartoon characters and also the carousel ride apart from the numerous gift shops, food carts and restaurants along the way. In the sweltering heat of Singapore, a comfy attire will make your day more pleasant too.",Universal Studios Singapore

Ankita R,5.0,"June 13, 2019",Fun filled day!!,Always wanted to visit Universal studios and the day spent here was worth it. There are many good rides but you need to wait for a long time in the queues as the place is really crowded all the time. For me the best rides were transformers and mummy one. Shreks caste is really beautiful! The merchandises available are expensive but are really cute. And the special appearances of the cute cartoon characters kinda brings back your childhood days! Overall an amazing experience !!,Universal Studios Singapore
pritee,5.0,"June 12, 2019",Universal studio,Prefer to buy express ticket of universal studio if you are interested in the all rides...as waiting time duration may be up to 30 to 40 min for most of ride during most of days and also as children may get impatient and it is tiring for them also,Universal Studios Singapore

Harpreet S,5.0,"June 11, 2019",Must do in Singapore,I have been to universal studios in Orlando and LA and wanted to make sure I see the third location as well. Visited it with my parents who have never seen one before and were up for a surprise. This is the smallest one but still definitely worth the visit.  The park is structured in a circle so that you can start in one direction and see the entire park in one lap. The rides and experiences are limited but easier to explore the whole park in less than a day without exhausting yourself. Only a couple of roller coasters (2 outdoors and 1 indoor) but the park has a good mix of thrill rides and family rides and theatre shows / experiences.  Check out the schedule before you visit. We unfortunately visited on a day when there was no parade / fireworks. Those events are definitely worth it and would recommend going on a day when they are happening.,Universal Studios Singapore
Larry Walker,2.0,"June 11, 2019",Boring nothing new,The problem with this park is that it hasn't gotten any new attractions in years. There's absoultely nothing special or unique. Transformers the ride hasn't even been upgraded to 4K. You can clearly see this park is licensed and not owned by Universal.,Universal Studios Singapore
Harr15,2.0,"June 11, 2019",Don't go there during peak times or if you have visited Universal studios in USA,"I had earlier visited Universal Studios in Florida and California and this was definitely a strong let down after these.  There's a limited amount of rides and the lines to popular (best) ones are ridiculous. Even the Express Pass lines were over 30+ minutes at times. And without it almost two hours. The lines are not controlled very well either and e.g. the single riders lines were heavily occupied by people trying to get into rides together with family members (and the staff allowed this). Not as organized as in US versions.  If you have never been to a similar park and are able to visit outside the holiday season this might be a good idea. But if you expect something similar than in US versions you might be disappointed. Also, do note that at many of the rides are exactly same as they are in US versions (depending on the view this is good or bad thing)",Universal Studios Singapore
MayurPatni,5.0,"June 10, 2019",Awesome Experience and a day well spent,"It was great to be back at universal Singapore. Our most enjoyed rides: 1. Battlestar Galactica: Cylon 2. Revenge of the Mummy 3. Transformers the ride  - Battlestar Galactica: Human was average compared to Cylon. - Lights, Camera, Action was enjoyable. - Sesame Street spaghetti space chase was really boring for a 12 year old- it’s for much younger children. - Waterworld show was entertaining. The show timings on Monday when we were there was 1 pm, 4:15 pm and 7 pm. It’s worth watching. It’s approx a 30 minutes show. - Canopy flyer was good fun. - Jurassic Park rapids adventure- my son enjoyed this a lot - you will get wet in this ride. You can buy a poncho for $2 before you get on the ride. Even with the poncho on, your shoes are likely to get wet. - Madagascar: A crate adventure was avoidable- again a ride for much younger kids. - Puss In boots giant journey - it’s a good thrilling ride which you can take with the family. Enjoyable.  We took the express unlimited pass - it is very expensive but it’s worth the money spent as 1 hour waiting’s are reduced to 5 minutes. This helped us do our favorite rides (all the 3 key roller coasters) thrice each! I strongly recommend buying this pass. Lots of snacking options throughout the park. Also lots of places to fill your water bottle- carry an empty bottle with you. Lunch options are good. For vegetarians, and wanting Indian food, head out to the Oasis of Spice in the Ancient Egypt area. Good food! Also you can get a margarita pizza and a vegetarian pasta in Loui’s pizzeria in New York area. Fantastic fun day with the family!",Universal Studios Singapore

Devi Yulyani,4.0,"June 10, 2019",awesome,"Your trip to Singapore wouldn't be complete if you don't put USS in your itinerary. But make sure you plan your trip earlier and avoid going to USS on weekend or during public holiday as the crowd at that time was no joke. For me, the best ride is Transformers but the long queue (about 2 hours) was killing me but still worth it. My advice, get something to eat while you're on the line such as a snack or an apple with mineral water so you don't stress yourself out. It's really fun and exciting experience!",Universal Studios Singapore
Nirinmart,4.0,"June 10, 2019",Invest in the Express tickets,"Sadly, not the best day to visit for us. Far too many people with no manners, intent on queue jumping. The Battlestar Galactica ride was in trouble all day. Twice we got to the front of the queue only for the ride to develop a technical hitch. Maybe because the show hasn't been on the TV for a long time, they aren't keeping it up as they should. There is now no merchandise to be bought at this ride. The Waterworld Show was, however, as entertaining as ever. I just wish we had taken the Express ticket option.",Universal Studios Singapore

vbrajesh,5.0,"June 9, 2019",Equally exiting for adults and kids.,"We entered the park at around 12:30 am and there was a huge rush , the park is divided into different part each having different theme like , Hollywood , far far away , the lost world , Madagascar , sci- fi , desert Safari , all of them have a few shows and few rides but the waiting part was very tiring , had to wait 40-50 min to enjoy a 40 sec to 1 min ride . The best rides were the roller coaster ride in the lost world section , transformer 4d ride cum show in the sci- fi section , 4d movie in the far far away section ,river rafting in the lost world section rest of the rides were so- so and not worth the waiting time ,but the those mentioned above were awesome and could be done more then once , but apart from ride the set up was magnificent and very imposing , the very idea of creating something so grand deserves great appreciation , since it was school holidays , the closing time was extended to 10:00 pm , which made it possible for us to explore the entire park otherwise it would have been impossible with the wait time , did I mention the fire cracker show in the end which with icing on the cake , for my Indian friend , there is a food joint by the name of Oasis which serves excellent , veg and non veg food which came in very handy. An important observation was that after 5:30 pm the waiting time reduced to 10-15 min and it was during this time that we were able to enjoy majority of the rides . One more tip would be to stay at sentosa island to make most of the attraction at sentosa , We stayed at Amara resorts which was at walking distance from the universal studios and we could enjoy it till the very end .",Universal Studios Singapore
Martin B,2.0,"June 9, 2019",Forget it,"It is noisy, very noisy, everywhere... It is crowded, almost all attactions 40 min Lines or more..we should and would have bought Express Tickets to at least enjoy it...although then it is a lot of money to stay in a noisy area ...",Universal Studios Singapore

I loved the roller-coasters rides that are pretty impressive, and we also very much enjoyed the Water World stunt show that should not be missed. I would recommend to go for the Express unlimited pass that allows you to skip the queues, which makes a huge difference in terms of experience ! A little bit pricey option but definitely worth it",Universal Studios Singapore
ryansim123,5.0,"June 9, 2019","Thrilling, Exciting, Suitable for All","Paid a visit here on 8th Jun Saturday. As it is a weekend, there was high human traffic in the park, although car park spots were aplenty. The waiting time for rides are also longer than usual, with some rides having a wait time of 80 mins (Jurassic Boat ride), but if you go and take the rides at the early evening ( approx 6pm onwards), queue and crowd is alot shorter. Personally, I think the rides and shows are great, however, they are quite old already, maybe time for a change? Food is not great, but not the worst however price is on the high side. If you intend to come on a Saturday or PH, do wait till 7.30pm for the parade and 10pm for fireworks display.",Universal Studios Singapore
Soedibyo L,5.0,"June 9, 2019",Cleanest place in south east asia playground,Clean and fun. Children love it. But the food just like any other fun park : expensive and average taste. You can eat at Din tai fung at entrance and hardrock. Those are the better restaurants,Universal Studios Singapore
CTC5118,5.0,"June 9, 2019",Place of fun and thrilling,"Not matter how old you are , you will surely enjoy it. What you need to know?] 1. Buy Universal Express ticket as well. I know its expensive but it is really worth it if you only visiting this place for a day as it greatly saves your time in the line or else you will end up waiting almost one hour for one game and at the end you will miss other games. This ticket does not cover all rides though like canopy flyer, Battlestar galactic (roller coaster), treasure hunt (waste of your time). 2. Food there is expensive however if have no choice then eating there cause you can't exist to come back. So prepare to spent 3. Try to go on Friday and Saturday as the opening time is from 10am -10pm so you have more time. Believe me, with express pass I was only manage to complete at 9pm all the rides. 4.Get the schedules of shows so that you can manage your time  Best ride but scary to max are Cylon an inverted roller coaster and revenge of mummy. Makes your heart stop.",Universal Studios Singapore
irenevff,4.0,"June 8, 2019",hot and humid but fun,"despite the weather and the big crowd, we still enjoyed our first visit as a family (this is my second time). my son was terrified while riding the roller coaster with our feet hanging. but he enjoyed terribly our transformers and the mummy rides. we skipped jurassic park because of the 70 minutes waiting time although we brought extra clothes in case we got wet from the ride.  it was exhausting but exhilarating at the same time. drinking water was strategically located within the theme park so thirst is not a problem. food is not allowed inside but there are several restaurants serving meals to your liking.  wifi is available anytime all throughout the park care of resorts world. it was fast and reliable.  universal studios is a happy place as long as you bring with you lots of stamina and loads of extra cash.",Universal Studios Singapore
VineetMalani,4.0,"June 8, 2019",Crowded but fun,"Universal Studios isn't the biggest theme park, you can probably take a round in about 15 minute's worth of brisk walk. It is divided into zones like Egypt, Shrek world, Sci-fi city etc. Four to five rides in each of the six zones catering to all age groups. It opens at 10 in the morning and it helps be there as the gates open especially on a crowded day like we encountered. We were hoping to get by with just our park tickets but within half hour realized that without Express pass we won't be able to cover even half of it.  Express pass is sold in nearly all stores inside the park, we bought ours for a King's ransom at the Hollywood street. The pass price fluctuates as the crowd levels rise and fall, It's probably best to buy it beforehand on their website where we saw it listed the cheapest. Armed with pass we were able to bypass wait times that sometimes extended beyond 90 minutes.  Some of the more memorable rides were Puss'n'boots roller coaster, Cyclone and Transformers 3D ride. The live action show called Waterworld was quite a crowd puller, even the large arena was packed to capacity. They cancelled their evening show midway with worsening weather but we returned for the evening one since it had piqued our curiosity.  We had our lunch at a self serve pizzeria called Loui's. Most cuisines were covered in the various restaurants located around the park, there was even an Indian food court near the Mummy returns ride. The slushies and drinks were expensive for the initial buy with them selling the park branded sippers but the refills were cheaper later.  I'd recommend taking the boardwalk from Vivocity mall down to Universal like we did. It's free and you would enjoy walking over a sea bridge, especially if the weather is pleasant. Universal is practically the first thing you hit once on Sentosa Island. For return you can take the free monorail out from the nearby RWS station.",Universal Studios Singapore

Prior the ride we had to put all our bags etc in a locker and it was free of charge for 45 min. both the rides are less than 3 min and after staying at the queue ~30 min, we complete one. when we moved to the other one we had to wait in the queue morethan 1 hr and finally it was announced that due to a technical matter, it will be delayed. after spend another 15min we came out, still they charge us couple of dollars even it's their fault. similarly in water world also, we wait 2hr + in the queue and same thing happen. most of attractions like shrek 4D were closed.

You can experience your gut going upside down here as they don't have one or two but 6 roller coasters. They have two water rides for the water lovers. Not only rides but their shows and attractions also add up to the pleasure of the children visiting the park. They won't let you feel pale and you can always stock up more calories with ample of restaurants and food joints in each theme arena.

Kyle,3.0,"June 5, 2019",Trip to universal studios,"Worth checking out if your a family with kids whilst in singapore. One adult cost $79SGD but can be more if you get ticket deals like express line addons.but if your are visiting solo they offer solo lines where they are free and just as quick maybe quicker then the express addon..tho can just jump over the 3 foot barrier once in line to express line on most rides;).as if you go as soon as it opens you could be waiting upto 45 minutes for rides. T he madagascar water ride is probaly only good to ride on if you have young kids that enjoy it otherwise it will be abit boring for you unless you were about 6 years old.  The jurrasic park rides are great rides.the canopy flyer is good but it goes for about 2p seconds so you will literally get all pumped up on it then before you know it yoi will be exiting the ride.if it was longer it would be good, The water raft in jurrasic world is another good ride.but if you dont mind getting drenched by water i suggest having a poncho on the ride and enjoy the dinosaur ride and visual effects around you,tho if your shoes do get wet i can bet they proably will there is a drying machine just outside the exit and souviner shop where i think it was $2SGD to get it working  Revenge of the mummy was probaly my faviroute ride there as the whole scenery was quite extrodinary with the eygptian statues etc for the ride cause i like that stuff but the ride was just fun with alot turns and bumps so its worth checking out  Battlestar galactia is also my 2nd pick as it was your best rollercoaster there which was fast and exciting.if you have any objects in your pocket tho coins,wallet,passport or phone its best to leave them behind in the locker nearby or with whomever as you will be checked with metal detector as precaution before you enter just for safety.  Transformers ride i did not go on tho the line up was pretty long as i waited in express for 20 minutes then just got over it and left as a monsoon just comeover  Lockers are around the park and are free for the first 45minutes then after that you will have to pay.  Plenty of shops and resturants are in the park tho resturants and fastfood are abit pricey but the souviner shops have great items for all ages at resonable prices   T",Universal Studios Singapore

Dubaipilot,4.0,"June 5, 2019",Nice experience with minor bumps,"We picked a weekday to go to USS, however expecting a pasty minute rush due to the Singapore school holidays, we decided to go in the morning 30m after the park opened. When we entered the park at 1040, the crowds were moderate and ride wait times ranged between 5 to 15m. We opted not to use our express pass in the beginning due to short wait times in the normal queue. But post 1130, the crowds started building and the most popular rides, including Battlestar galactica and Transformers had between 45-60m wait times. I would highly recommend buying the express pass as it is a big advantage with max wait times not more than 5-10m. The only “bump” was a rather impatient usher at the Shrek ride and the fact that the ride was converted from a 4D experience to a 3D only due technical issues i presume. However they should have announced this outside so that people would have the choice either to enter or not. The Shrek ride without the 4D experience is just not worth the wait of around 20m ... other than this, i would say that the USS experience is good.",Universal Studios Singapore

Study the map thoroughly to select the activities you aspire to spend time on and go for it wisely. Most of the tourist places in Singapore have a dedicated photo corner where the visitors are clicked on camera and then on your exit the photos are available for sale for approx. SGD 23.

One must say that I entered the Universal Studio at about 1 pm very well knowing the on select weekend the studio is open till 10 am. The universal studios is little small as compared to the one in US but still a great place to visit when in Singapore. There are lot number of rides and shows which one can see and enjoy. I selected afternoon time to beat the heat of Singapore which is pretty much there till 4.30 pm and post that it cools down a bit. The tourist rush post 4.30 or 5 pm had also settled down and it was easy to access the rides. Ordinarily on a rush days the waiting is approx 45 minutes so one can consider shelling out extra buck for express line. The rides were good. The food inside the Universal Studio has lot more varities and cater to the appetite of all the country. There were lot of rides for the kid with 92 CMS of height which was littte unusual but yes my kid did enjoy it. The parade of the artist on that day was at 7.30 pm which was good and fun. Post, that a live music was being played and it made the environment lively. I believe post 7 pm they serve alcohol too.  To sum up fund to be there when in Singapore.",Universal Studios Singapore
197gabes,1.0,"June 3, 2019",Poorly operated theme park,"USS was once a gem but it is starting to show its age. Despite operating in tropical Singapore for so long it has done little to improve visitor’s experiences. It is still too humid in the heat and just lack proper sheltered area or alternative attractions when it rains.  USS may have added a few new attractions and expand the park over the years but at the same time seem to have forgotten to upkeep the rest of the older rides and shows.  There are so many issues observed in a single visit. If a queue to a ride or show is open, one would expect it to be operating fully but during our visit the Transformer ride has TV monitors at the queue that were faulty and wet floor at the queue area (and it was indoors and not even raining outside). This was not the only ride fault. At the Shrek 4D show, it was worst as none of the effects were in operation (might as well call it Shrek 3D) during the last slot timing. Over at the King Julien’s Go-Round, the ride’s up and down mechanism seems jerky (no wonder they advise safety belts). Even the shows have their share of ‘technical’ difficulties, the Elmo show stopped abruptly midway and the visitors were told to leave the theater. Paint works around the park have peeled from either from wear and tear or just poor maintenance.  The staff at the park also seems to lack proper training as announcements are inaudible, they do not manage the queue or able to give clear directions to various attractions. Most seems to lack the motivation to serve and do not exhibit any friendly welcoming vibes.  All these issue just sums up to a poorly manage theme park. It is a total waste of time and money to visit the place at its current state. For just abit more money for ticket admission, you would be visiting other larger and better theme parks around the region for a better overall experience.",Universal Studios Singapore
Irajan,5.0,"June 3, 2019",It’s okay for a days visit,Down load the app to plan your visit. We went on a busy and hot day and the wait time was 45 minutes. The crowd is uncouth and will cut the line despite protests. Food is pricey just like any amusement park.,Universal Studios Singapore
amita,5.0,"June 3, 2019",Must visit,One must visit there . It's one of the best things to experience.  If you have kids buy express pass to avoid ques and you would get dirct entry to any ride and shows.,Universal Studios Singapore
Donna T,4.0,"June 3, 2019",Fun day,We got to Universal approx 45 mins before opening and we’re first at the gate. We did pay extra to skip the queues and I’m glad we did. We did everything 3 times and left about 4pm. It was a hot day and we couldn’t see anywhere to fill up a water bottle. To buy water was expensive I thought.,Universal Studios Singapore
Sudeesh B,4.0,"June 3, 2019",Excellent experincebut the waiting time is too much,"I would have given a 5 star if the long waiting time could have been avoided. Yes, an express ticket will eliminate the waiting time. but it is very expensive. While you waiting, you may feel like paying the extra dollars There are only 2 shows for sea world. So plan your visit such a way that you catch one of those shows. I preferred the evening show. The shows like Tranformer , Jurassic park etc. have long waiting time. Make sure to reach the place at 9 AM itself so that you can cover most of the rides. Dont forget to take snaps as photography is allowed in most of the places with an excpetion oif few rides. Drinking water is available on the waiting area and the rest rooms. Take your flask with you. You may have to use the locker for entring shows like Jurassic where you are almost sure to get wet. Free Wifi is available and hence it can be used for communication within your group , even if you dont have Singapore SIM. Go prered to spend w whole day and Enjoy.",Universal Studios Singapore
Anu1883,5.0,"June 3, 2019",you don't want to miss this one...,"You should definitely buy the express pass to avoid the long wait. Lots of rides available for adults and kids, amazing shows, we spent the whole day there but definitely worth it.",Universal Studios Singapore

brownsWestYorkshire,5.0,"June 2, 2019",A great day out,"We had a great day at Universal Studios. Plenty of rides for all ages, with different shows to watch. Not a great selection of food outlets, but we were able to find something to eat. Worth buying the fast pass if you want shorter times in queues.",Universal Studios Singapore
Slovo,5.0,"June 2, 2019",Great Day at Universal,Our family did two laps around this park in about four hours. We did pay the S$60 per person to skip lines and it was totally worth it. Many times we walked right on and even did the Gallactica Coasters in about 7 minutes each. (Friday afternoon) Mummy ride was great. Madagascar was a sleeper,Universal Studios Singapore
Vince T,5.0,"June 1, 2019",Time your visit,"A chore if you go during the crowded hours, rides waiting time can be 30 mins or more. The trick is to go later afternoon or early evening when waiting time drops to 5 mins. The mummy side is a must!",Universal Studios Singapore
Nena G,5.0,"May 31, 2019",Wonderful day!,Adults and kids have a great time while here! We spend the whole day in this place and we wanted more!

the travel hub australia,5.0,"May 31, 2019",Bee here many times and it is always a good day,try going mid week to maximise the enjoyment of the park and don't forget to watch the live shows. there are free lockers with timers near the main roller coasters so take advantage of this to share all your belongings in before lining up.,Universal Studios Singapore

Ilusiv,5.0,"May 30, 2019",Awesome,A must do if in Singapore/Sentosa.  A large variety of different rides and attractions.  Staff were friendly and it was clean and tidy.  Food and merchandise were expensive just like any other amusement park.  If travelling with kids I wouldn’t bother if they are under 4 or 107cm. At that point they can do all but three rides (the Mummy and the two main roller coasters)  We went on a weekday and the queues were mostly okay. The only annoying thing was when queues were long on some rides they would have so many people who bought the express pass ($90 extra - a complete rip off) that the regular person queue wouldn’t move...  Our 4 year old loved it. Not much for our two year old however.,Universal Studios Singapore
_michaell_traveller_,5.0,"May 30, 2019",Excellent,Must visit place if you’re with kids. The battlestar galactica roller coaster is the best. The food is pretty good too. You should spend a full day here to make the most of it!,Universal Studios Singapore
Sampath99,5.0,"May 30, 2019",Not to be missed while you are in Singapore,"This is an amazing place to hang out - either as a family or with friends or alone. The place has something for everyone. It rained the day we visited and unfortunately one of the popular rides (Jurassic Park) had to be cancelled. This is done purely to ensure the safety of visitors. We personally liked all the 4D shows, transformers. The place takes you back into the bygone memory lanes where you can cherish each and every activity. Would recommend an express ticket if you are planning to visit on a weekend. There are lot of meal options available",Universal Studios Singapore
Tya A,5.0,"May 30, 2019",Various attractions from Egypt to Jurassic!,"Even though it was so hot but we were having fun! We tried the Returns of mummy, Elmo, Transformers, Battlestar Galactica until Jurassic park! Well, you have to prepare to be wet in Jurassic park",Universal Studios Singapore
Karan,2.0,"May 29, 2019",Nice place with poor management...highly unorganised,Been there in the month of May 19 with family...was very excited to visit this place however it soon became a shock on seeing long queues in front of every ride and attraction...then got to know that one needs to have express pass...no facility for parents with infants...staff is not willing to listen to anything...they need to put a capping on the no of people visiting them on any given day...by doing this will enhance the customer experience and would also create repeat visitors...one more thing fans installed in queue area are not working...this is the least thing expected out of such a big setup,Universal Studios Singapore
thdel,4.0,"May 29, 2019",Big disappointment,Been world class theme park the organisers should aware what alternatives when there is a weather warning. Just a drizzle and all out door rides cancelled leaving visitors stranded for hours with no activities while queuing up for one ride in hundreds. Not a good experience. Chaotic crowd control. But the rides are well choreographed. Adrenaline is high and worth. Food and beverage outlets are world class. Merchandise and other items are good.,Universal Studios Singapore
Williyam S,5.0,"May 29, 2019",Nice place for kids and adult,"The best time to take your children to USS is at least 122 cm height so they can play most of the rides.  The waterworld show is a MUST. Very entertaining.  Revenge of the mummy worth to que. Transformers, battle of galactic, very recommended to those who like roller coaster.  The best thing is this place is very strict of safety of all rides. We were queing for almost 1 hours for Jurrasic Park Rapids Adventure, and we had to stop all the rides because there was indication lightning approaching in 8 Kilometers. And we have to wait for that lightning clouds to go then we continue the rides. Tumbs up 👍👍",Universal Studios Singapore
Rajeev Kothari,4.0,"May 29, 2019",Fun fo KIDS & Adults,"It was fun experience for the entire family. You can practically spend the entire day there and still be short of time. Would recommend to visit on weekdays to avoid rush and express pass. Please carry bottle of water and refill it as water is very expensive in USS. We visited in May which was very hot and water consumption was high due to heat and humidity. Wear light clothes, sport shoes, sun screen, sun glasses and cap. Also carry extra pair of clothes for Kids if they happen to get wet. In the evening there are road shows which are fun. They do not allow outside food however if do carry doctor note, they will allow. We booked our tickets from Changi Recommend online which turned out to be the cheapest after the offer.",Universal Studios Singapore

Elizabeth Rebecca Jones,2.0,"May 28, 2019",Massively overrated,"Spent our last day in Singapore at Universal as we had seen what we wanted within the city centre. If you’re an avid theme park goer like myself and my partner are then I wouldn’t bother spending your money here. There was only 2 good-ish rides and the park was very small. Compared to Alton Towers or Thorpe Park then this park was not worth it. MASSIVELY overpriced at S$150 for two people. If you want to claim a GST refund remember to take a form of ID. They wouldn’t give me one as I didn’t have my passport. All in all, not worth the price but it was ok.",Universal Studios Singapore
Gauravtraveller13,4.0,"May 28, 2019",Great adventure rides,I have given 4 star only for long queues but attraction is excellent and should not be missed.

Girish T,3.0,"May 28, 2019",Just ok,"If you have visited Universal in US, go with low expectations. One roller coaster (hanging one) is good, transformer ride is good, rest all is just ok.

John P,4.0,"May 27, 2019",Great place for families,"Been to Universal in America and Japan and thought we would make it a tri factor by going to Singapore. Thought it would might have had some Singapore flavour but it was the same as the others just a bit smaller. However if you are a family looking for something to entertain the kids, it will suffice. Don't forget to take a container to fill up with water once you get through the gates as you are not allowed to take fluids in but food is okay.",Universal Studios Singapore
Manoj Chhabria,5.0,"May 27, 2019",Had a good time,One would require a full day for Universal studios. They studio is divided into sections. Don't waste time on any one section. The best was the 4D Shrek show and the rides in Jurassic park. Do carry eatables with you and keep drinking lots of water. The sovneior shops for chocolates are worth a buy. Overall had a good experience.,Universal Studios Singapore
sunny38,3.0,"May 27, 2019",Not like North American Universal if that’s what you expect,"If you are the type of person who enjoys thrill seeking rides Universal Singapore is fairly calm and does not offer much. We have been to Universal Orlando a few times and found this park to be quite disappointing. I had read up prior to arrival and it was recommended to buy the express pass. We bought the single ride entry express pass and with that and our park entry ticket it cost $258.00 for 2 adults. The park is actually quite small, and took us no time to get around. We arrived at 10am, and found that at that time the express pass was not even required, most rides had about a 5min wait. We did use it on the Transformers ride, which had a hour wait by 11am. There are a few good rides, the Mummy, Transformers, and the 2 main roller coasters, but overall we did not feel it was worth it. We left the park around 11:40am after giving our express passes away to a young couple. To be fair, if you had a young family I’m sure it would be more enjoyable, but as 2 adults we were not impressed with the rides, or the park in general. There are a few show, which we did not see, and many retail and eating spots, and you can get a re-entry stamp.",Universal Studios Singapore
MrsAngieMP,4.0,"May 27, 2019",Great fun but very hot,Great fun. Tickets quite pricey but they do allow entry into some of the rides/attractions Highlight of our trip was meeting Bumblebee and Optimus Prime as our son is a huge Transformers fan. Long lines for the bigger rides but that’s to be expected in any theme park. Bring a stroller or hire one once you get there so your little ones can rest as it can get quite hot without the added struggle of carrying the kids everywhere,Universal Studios Singapore
Sinjini U,5.0,"May 27, 2019",Life time exp.must plan with kids above 6yrs.,A place where all category of PPL will enjoy. There are different sections of places for different categories. A lot of walking required so ensure you wear comfortable dress and shows. Carry caps and water bottles for kids.water is available at various places for refilling. Loads of places to click pics with the cartoon characters.,Universal Studios Singapore
chriso308,5.0,"May 26, 2019",Small but awesome,"I have been to Universal studios in the US ,Japan and Singapore. But this time in Singapore it was with my 4 year old. This is the smallest of the three I've been to but it doesn't disappoint! Virtually no waiting for rides and excellent food.  Pros... Great selection of big and small kid rides Really great quality food Friendly helpful staff Really easy to get around Virtually no waiting for rides Just a great place to take kids  Cons.... Not as big as other Universal studios theme parks but still heaps of fun.  Well worth the $$$$ Get to the gate 20 min before opening hit the rides early and shop in air conditioning in the afternoon.  Just one more thing I'd like to mention that isn't the parks fault but does happen on every Que for every ride is ..... the Indians! I've never been to India but I'm guessing cutting in line is acceptable there. They send someone to get in line and then when the rest of their group show up the politely shuffle to the front one at a time until there is 8 or 9 in front of you. Or when you are lined up for a ride that is clearly designed for kids under 5 years old and 40 or more adult Indian people with express passes line up and have everyone else's small children waiting in the sun for grandma ,grandpa ,all the uncle's and aunts, mum and dad to have a ride with their one member of their group under 5yrs old. Like I said this is not the parks fault but if you have a short fuse with line jumpers and grown ups riding kids stuff while your kid is roasting in the sun because a 55 year old man rides the merry go round , you will need to know this is going to happen",Universal Studios Singapore
Mark Dring,4.0,"May 26, 2019",Good place,"Ticket's a little expsensive, but it' s super large, a lot of games, it's worth. Came here from vietnam, so I felt that everthing in this place's more expensive than in vietnam.",Universal Studios Singapore
SchubeyDoo,4.0,"May 26, 2019",Great fun had by all,"When planning your trip think of the park map like a clock and tackle it either clockwise or anti clockwise depending on your age group. All the larger rides are to the right after you walk down the main street so if that’s what you’re there for walk anti clockwise and do them first. We arrived about 9:30am ready for the gates to open and went straight to the larger roller coaster rides. We had multiple turns on Human, Cylon and Revenge of the Mummy with hardly any wait in the first hour. After this though the queue time extended out to 90 mins. It paid to be flexible though as at times we wandered past again the wait time was only 20mins so would line up for another turn. The Water World show was awesome and if you sit near the front be prepared to get wet. Meals start at around SGD 15 for a burger/drink combo and go up in price from there. The Transformers ride was great fun, my 11 year old does not like roller coasters and he had multiple turns on Transformers. Getting to Sentosa was easy on the MRT and then use the Sentosa Express from Vivo City. You can use your EZ-Link card for the Sentosa Express.",Universal Studios Singapore
Mathew Dominic,4.0,"May 25, 2019",Must visit when in singapore,"A must visit when in Singapore. Kids will absolutely love it. But there are enough stuff for adults as well. Mummy ride, waterworld show and tranformers were my personal favourites. Apart from the rides the whole atmosphere is just out of the world with photogenic places, character meet and greets etc  Not giving 5 star only because of the aggressive marketing. Also the food courts are very expensive with little quantity as well",Universal Studios Singapore

Our almost 2 & 4 year olds were able to enjoy some attractions and rides but missed out on most roller coaster type attractions. It would be best for kids 120cms and above to ensure they have maximum enjoyment.  Get there 20-30 mins before opening to avoid the busy periods after lunch.  Plenty of save places to lock up valuables and leave prams throughout the park.  Food and drink was reasonable.",Universal Studios Singapore

rangaface,4.0,"May 23, 2019",Always fun!,"My husband and I have been fortunate enough to visit Universal Studios in LA, Orlando and Japan - so we thought we better check out Universal Singapore to! The Madagascar, Shrek and Jurassic Park theme lands are great! We went on the Madagascar crate ride and loved how it was more of a theme ride then an experience ride. We wanted to then experience the Jurassic Park water ride but unfortunately the wait time was 80+ minutes! Being an extra hot and humid day in Singapore - we understand why the wait time unfortunately was so long.  We were thrilled to see Waterworld once again! Such a magnificent stunt show! Husband and I enjoy it every time! A must to see if you go!! Ensure you look at the show schedule so you don’t miss it!  Compared to other Universal Studios, we did find this park quite smaller. However, we still had a nice afternoon and were in and out the park within 3 hours.  We definitely recommend creating a theme section for How to Train Your Dragon! Such an amazing movie franchise and I can’t believe it hasn’t been included yet!!!",Universal Studios Singapore

For two of us in our early 30s we were expecting bigger rides of which there was really only 1. Its extremely expensive and we went on a Thursday thinking it would be quieter but still ended up paying for the express pass at $140 each (extremely over priced) although it was good as we saved hours on queueing.

We came here on Monday to avoid crowds but there was too much people almost all the day. We were standing in the lines for 1,5 hour to have 1 minute ride. It was terrible! We spend all day and it was not enough to try all the attractions. Also, only 4 or 5 were interesting, others were only for children. The funny thing was that almost all the time we were obligated to leave our stuff in lockers and these lockers were for free only for 30-40minutes. After that there was 4 dollars fee for every 20 minutes. But almost all the time we had to wait for the attraction for more that 1 hour, so it was so unfair.

We quickly made it on the first ride -The Mummy - with no issues but the ride was not fun at all. The next big rollercoaster had a wait. We then decided to pay an extra $40 US to get a fast pass which could be used once for all the rides. Though it got us through quickly on the next ride, we only ended up using it 2 more times. The Jurassic park ride was ineligible plus their water ride was closed. It was a huge rip off.  The park is relatively small that you could cover in a short time - depending on the ride lengths.

We went on all the rides all day and waited no longer than 20 minutes.

The ride that sets this park apart is Transformers, whatever you do, do not leave till you experience it. The inter-twining rollercoasters are fast and really nice. Some rides are quite unique. There seemed to be a section still under construction, it looks like a water park. A huge downside of this park is the queues are very misleading. The times on the boards are virtually always wrong. They also have a very devious way of turning the queues into different rooms or chambers hidden from each other, so you cant really see how far away you are from the ride. Having said that we experienced mostly moderate queues with the exception of 1 or 2 rides, time your day of visitng so you don't get bogged down or forced to buy a ridiculously expensive vip pass. We went on a Wednesday and Queues were mostly manageable except for the Jurassic park and Transformers ride. Stay away from the outrageously priced food and drinks, the indian restaurant in the Egyptian section is the most reasonable priced place. Make use of the numerous water fountains to quench your thirst, I will give them credit for that. A really good day out",Universal Studios Singapore
TopPaddock,4.0,"May 17, 2019",Good way to full in a day,Last went to Universal Studios in America almost 30 years ago. It didn’t live up to the enjoyment I had from it back then but was still ok. We paid $40 once inside for the express pass which was great value as it allowed you to avoid ques at 15 rides.,Universal Studios Singapore

Amelia M,5.0,"May 16, 2019",Night pass best way to explore the park,"We chose the night pass because we only arrived in Singapore at 4pm. Cost was $79 per person and we received 4 x $8 food vouchers that cant be used concurrently. We hardly queued for any rides as the park had quietened down considerably by the evening so this is a massive bonus! We spent about 4 hours in the park. Themes are Jurassic Park, The Mummy, Waterworld, Madagascar and Transformers. WELL WORTH IT!",Universal Studios Singapore
carly876,5.0,"May 16, 2019",Great day out for families,"We visited Universal Studios Singapore today (Thursday 16th May) and had a wonderful time! Our kids, aged 5 & 7 enjoyed the park immensely.  I read up on trip advisor and decided to get the fast passes. This was such a great choice for us as we didn't waste much of the day waiting in long lines. (There are a few rides not included on the fast pass). We arrived at opening time, and thanks to the fast pass, were able to go on every ride, see the waterworld show and meet many of the characters.  As you enter the park, most people head down Hollywood road and turn right, We turned left instead (towards Madagascar rides). It was so quiet we didn't need fast passes for the first 3 rides, so I would recommend going th opposite direction to the crowds.  Food was expensive, but so is everything else in Singapore!  All up, a great day out, made better by getting the fast passes!!",Universal Studios Singapore
Shantanu L,3.0,"May 16, 2019",Good for first time visitors to Universal Studios.,"Hello everybody! We visited USS in May 2019. Earlier we had visited Universal Studios in Orlando, US. As compared to the park in US, this park is smaller.  There were two incidences of technical failure during the rides. In one ride, Spaghetti Space Chase, we need to abort the ride because of technical issue. The other ride, Transformers, we had to wait for half an hour in the queue to get into the ride. This was so disappointing. We lost our valuable one hour because of these issues.  To sum up, if you have visited Universal Studios in Orlando, don’t visit USS.",Universal Studios Singapore
priyanka p,4.0,"May 15, 2019",Long waiting queue,We had the best time in Universal Studio! The reason for one star less is 1. Long waiting period which can go from 45 mins to 2 hours 2. Abruptly stopping the rides while waiting in the queue stating technical difficulties ( we faced that in the roller coaster ride in the mummy ‘s zone don’t remember the name now) 3. I loved they made safety as their top priority so this will be a bad luck if you go on a day when it’s raining or windy because they will close down the rides. For us the rides were closed for 30-45 mins before they started again.  Do try the transformers nest.. best experience we had,Universal Studios Singapore

aidaroundtheglobe,4.0,"May 14, 2019",Fun day with lots of excitement and... sweat!,"Like other theme parks, USS is one of the interesting place to visit for thrill seekers. They have the Transformers 4D rides which is a family favourite- so take note the que could get really really longgggg. My favourite indoor ride is The Mummy and it’s Good although it’s in the dark hehe. The cyclone rides were amazing (repeated 3 times) but didn’t get to experience the human rides (long que). Apparently people choose human rides because it’s less thrilling than the cyclone rides so that’s why the lines were shorter 👍 if you wanna get wet (like me), you could get on one of rides in Jurassic World but no worries there’s a drying pod for SGD5 only.  We went there on Sunday so the crowd was OK, so some rides has shorter que. Please check the weather before visiting as it could get tooo sunny or u don’t wanna get soaked in the rain. When we went there the weather was like 39 dgrees so we were in our sweats all the time😅  We loved the cafe located in front of the show theatre (forgot the name) coz it’s halal and there’s a cute Elmo burger😬. Other cafes are ok as well but we only tried 2 of them.  Most importantly we think that it’s not too big like some other Universal Studios so definitely you could complete the whole round in a day",Universal Studios Singapore
Carrol Willsher,4.0,"May 14, 2019",Go midweek and check weather prior,"Definitely go early week !! We did a Wednesday (full day) during school holidays. No express pass and most we waited was 20 minutes for rides. Had printed Klook passes, super easy straight through turnstyle into park. Pick up a daily timetable and map and take a moment to prioritise your must dos by time. Made the most of all the shows and planned day around them, not rides. Water world show was great and stunt actors even stayed after show to have photos taken. Kids will love IT. Each ride has a digital display showing approximate wait time. We used these to find the quickest wait times and came back to the rides that were too busy previously. Donkey live show is a must for all ages, as is Shrek 4D experience and the Transformers 4D ride.  The meet and greets with characters are on time and well organised by park staff, who are happy to use your camera to take photos. No pressure to buy professional photos at any time. If the weather turns bad, all the outdoor rides are stopped, so plan your visit around the weather if possible. Most rides you can take your bags on except for rollercoasters, they have shelves or lockers for your belongings. There are plenty of well sign posted toilets, most offering a free water bottle refill station too. No issues with taking a large water bottle in with you.",Universal Studios Singapore
holl3411,3.0,"May 14, 2019",Check the weather forecast before you go.,"We visited during the Easter holidays. Having previously visited other Universal parks, we were mindful of the fact that this park would be a little more limited in size and have fewer of the large rides. The park is similar in size or scale to Euro Disney with perhaps 3/4 larger rides for the teenagers.  We bought our tickets as part of a combined ticket with the Sentosa Cable Car, which was a reasonable deal. A short taxi from the hotel to Mount Faber meant we started the day with a bit of an adventure for the kids. (You can buy the combined ticket at the Mount Faber cable car station.) Having tickets in advance meant queuing for entry to the park itself was not too bad, although signage from the cable car stop on Sentosa to the Universal park could be better. (Once you disembark on Sentosa, you actually need to walk about 100 yards and change onto an additional cable car to take you to the park entrance.)  Getting there early meant that the queue times for the main rides was about 15-20 minutes. It’s worth mentioning that the ride staff are very hot on making sure you don’t take anything on the rides with you e.g. phones and loose change, making sure pockets are empty and going to the extent of using a security wand to check every rider to make sure. If they find anything, they send you back to the lockers. Each large ride has it’s own lockers which are free for an initial period, but cost thereafter. We also rented a larger locker for our backpack, which we had to pay for.  Unfortunately on the day we visited the weather was patchy with occasional rainstorms. If there is any threat of thunder/lightning then the larger rides are temporarily stopped. Clearly this is done from a safety perspective to avoid lightening strikes. However the rides don’t handle this particularly well. We waited approximately 50 minutes for the Battlestar Galactica Cylon ride. Having got to within 5 people of boarding the ride, the ride was suspended due to the incoming thunder storm. No indication is given on how long the delay will be. (Clearly the park has some form of weather monitoring to be able to suspend the ride in advance, so surely some form of indication of the length of the potential suspension is possible, or alternatively, offer a temporary fast pass option to those who have queued.)  While the weather was bad we watched the WaterWorld show, which is a water based stunt show. This was very well done. The marking of the seats as to whether you will get wet or not is worth noting. The wet seats get an absolute soaking both before and during the show.  It was a fun day despite the weather. It’s easily possible to do the bulk of the larger rides in half a day, meaning you can visit some of the other attractions on Sentosa.",Universal Studios Singapore
PamelaRogers1313,5.0,"May 14, 2019",A whole day of fun!,"I absolutely enjoyed my time at Universal studios. The rides were fantastic, there was a variety of rides which made my day fun and exciting.  Dining options are great too. I recommend the fast pass because queues can be rather long at the top rides. My favourite ride was ""The mummy"" - we probably went on it 15 times :))",Universal Studios Singapore
Travel Journey,5.0,"May 13, 2019",GREAT EXPERIENCE,"GREAT FUN DAY /GREAT EXPERIENCE SO,How to Get to Universal Studios by MRT Taking the train to Universal Studios is easy. ALL you need to do is get down at Harbourfront station and then either take the mono-rail train or walk to Sentosa Island. Here are more detailed directions: 1.Take the North East Line going to Harbourfront. Alight at the last stop — Harbourfront Station. 2.Walk into the VivoCity Mall and climb to Level 3 of the Mall, its near in KFC Proceed to Lobby L. You know you’re at Lobby L when you see Food Republic. You might want to have breakfast or lunch before going to Sentosa. :) 3.Fall in line and purchase a ticket. Keep your ticket. Don’t lose it. Board the monorail train. Alight at Waterfront Station. 4.Follow the signs and you’ll find yourself staring at the Universal Studios rotating globe soon after. 5.You can also take the Sentosa Boardwalk to get to the island. It’s a fun experience, too! Best during sunset! --For us we didn't avail the ticket to get inside cause we have only 2days tour in SG if you go inside you have to spend your whole day there cause its a lot of activities inside but if you travel with kids you must add this in your list your kids will love it ,so we prefer not to buy ticket inside since we are only couple .We just enjoying the view from the Rotating global after that we headed to Garden by the bay till the lightshow begin ,we visit the flower dome and cloudforest there also while waiting for the light show from garden by the bay , so in 1 day we visit sentosa island,universal,garden by the bay ,flower dome,cloudforest in just 1 click =Tiring but worth it.

DokGrey,5.0,"May 12, 2019",Perfect,"We went here on a friday because the park closes at 10pm. We went early and planned our rides. Not crowded as expected. We love the transformers ride, waterworld show, puss in boots,treasure hunter, sesame street, donkey live, almost everything we like. We got the time of the shows and were.able.to fix our sched to see everything even marilyn monroe live show. Everything was perfect. The kids had a blast. The only thing is the price of the food, very expensive. The park is also small relative to universal studios japan. But for me i like it since we can go directly to the shows immediately. Definitely.highly recommended. Get your ticket at an online booking site. Very cheap and they also give promo codes. Plan your trip.also around 6:30pm there only few people.left hence we got all the rides for ourselves. Also go to the waterworld where the parade of stars starts. Hence when you finish seeing it go back to attraction or rides that you like im sure you will be the only one there because everyone are watching the parade. We were able to ride again every rides that the kids likes more than twice.   ",Universal Studios Singapore

Tim E,5.0,"May 12, 2019",Can you tell me how to get to Sesame Street?,"What a great time to visit Universal Singapore, celebrating Sesame Street 50th birthday, and they sure did celebrate, made me feel like a child again. This park is way smaller then the original in California, but has some of the same attractions done way better, and some new different rides. We opted for the express pass package, twice the price as a general admission, but as we had limited time, and it was school holidays thought we wouldn't see everything in the one day. It was a very hot day when we visited, so being near any water attractions was great. The park itself is well maintained and easy to navigate around. Great for all ages. Recommend the Universal Shop for purchases to take home with you.",Universal Studios Singapore

Siddhartha Shankar Dey,4.0,"May 11, 2019",Good place to spend an entire day with kids,"It is a full day program in Universal studio. If you are travelling to Singapore with kids, please add Universal studio to your list. Make sure you avoid the weekends. Standing in queue time is much longer than the short ride time. My advice is to buy the fast lane ticket (approx 40 SGD per head) to avoid queue. Instead of trying each ride focus on types of ride. Some rides are truly fast and may not be suitable for younger kids. Be in the studio when it opens if you want to cover everything. I personally liked the 4D simulation of Transformer.",Universal Studios Singapore
Summer0630,5.0,"May 11, 2019",Small kids will definitely enjoy the exploring the place,"We visited USS first time with my 5-year old daughter. Booked our ticket thru the package offered by Bay Hotel Singapore while my daughter’s ticket was booked via Klook. It was fair weather and enjoyed the place. We were able to take good pictures as it was a sunny day. My daughter enjoyed the attractions of Sesame Street and Shrek. However, queues can be too long and would take you 30mins -1hour to get in each attraction or ride. We didn’t buy the express pass as the price is the same as the ticket price. Food is not allowed inside but you can bring bottled water. Everything is quite expensive from food, merchandise, pictures, etc. But we enjoyed the place as we explored and took photos.",Universal Studios Singapore

Although there are options for ages, my son was the perfect age as he was able to go on all rides. We even went on his favourite 4 times! Although this theme park as been around for some years, all rides were impressive and well maintained. After getting over the entry cost, it was a really enjoyable day.

From the opening time, even the kids rides had a wait almost an hour. On that day the weather was extremely hot, so waiting around in the heat for close to an hour or even 2 hour for a ride that only goes for a minute or 2 is ridiculous.

LucasDize,3.0,"May 8, 2019",Express Pass ruins it,"Don't get me wrong, the park is fun, it could've been bigger but still ok, some rides are excellent. My favourites were the transformers, the mummy, camera action show and the rollercoaster (the one your legs are hanging). Food is ridiculously expensive, I've been to many amusement parks, I always expect it to be, but this one is so over. You can cross the bridge to Sentosa by walking for free and still take the train back for free. Transport around the island is free as well.  Due to bad weather, outside attractions stayed closed for around 2h, really bad, made everything else much busier.  But, what really ruins the park, is the express pass. You can pay ~$40 for skipping the line once for every attraction or ~$70 for unlimited.  Problem is, sometimes it gets so crowded, the queue is so long, that it is bad for everyone.  I was at the queue for a rollercoaster, it was saying 30min waiting, and then people with express pass started to come (there's a different queue for them), and they were coming quicker then the rollercoaster could take, so we started to have 2 queues, one for regular other for express, and the worst, only their queue was moving! There was times were 15minutes would pass and my queue wouldn't move, only theirs!  I ended up staying for almost 2h in the line, for a 1:30min ride, totally crap.  And even for those who paid express pass, it's not a big deal. Have you magined if everyone has it? You are not skipping anymore, and the park is making much more money..  Another good move would be to put signs along the queue path indicating how long is the waiting time from that point. Most of the time, the queue is curvy and you can't see the end of it, so you have no idea of how far you really are.  My tip for you: unless you're a teenager with lots of energy to spend standing in a queue, don't go in the morning and don't give them more money for a express pass. Go in the afternoon, around 4pm, it's not that warm anymore, on weekend it closes at 10pm, so you still have 6h left, and all the rides have almost no queues.",Universal Studios Singapore

Longest we spent in a queue was 90 minutes to go on the Battlestar Galactica roller coaster and the shortest was 10 minutes for the Transformers ride, both on par with each other for fun in my opinion. The sort of place I’d only do once but I’m glad we did, as we did have fun. There are lockers available for those rides that require it, and plenty of shops and other attractions to take up your time and money!

Enjoy as much as you can, if you're still up for a thrill, Look for the wall climbing near within the Jurasic park.  If you have time, check for the itinerary of street entertainment and Waterworld show. you can also go Outside to eat for lunch, its way cheaper,  If you have extra, and wanted to have souvenier, go to the food park in front of Jurasic Park, Buy a beverage, it comes with a cup.

TMSChennai,4.0,"May 7, 2019",Must visit in Singapore,"My family and I thought this will be the highlight of our visit, and we were not disappointed, though I felt that the Staff there have become extraordinarily complacent. When we pay good money at the gate, we expect all rides to function. They conveniently stopped the Jurassic World Rapids Ride and almost stopped Revenge of the Mummy ride but I think the anger of the crowds made them restart the spectacularly scary Ancient Egyptian treat.  Some tips:  1. The food there is expensive and of very high quality. Indian Food being the best. A family of 4 can order 1 Mutton Biriyani, they will add lots of veggies with it, so add 4-5 parathas with that and share. 2. They did not check us for water bottles, so try your luck. 3. We went on a Sunday, so wait times were like 70-80 minutes for main rides. I bought the express ticket. Worth the extra money as our wait times were 2 minutes and we could enjoy hours of the Hollywood Ambience after we completed our rides. 4. You have to bring your passport if you want to do rock climbing. Total hassle, avoid. 5. Water World Show is at 12:30 and 4 PM, so plan accordingly.

Fisalida,4.0,"May 7, 2019",Great day at the end! Be aware of the weather!,"We visited on a Saturday with a normal pass but after going to get on the first ride we decided to purchase the Express pass. We went to our first ride and it was amazing to skip 60mins queue. However, going to our second ride they didn’t let us get on, there were some thunders and they were afraid a thunderstorm was coming and didn’t know when the rides would be back on again. We decided to ask for a refund for the very expensive ($120) express pass we just paid but apparently they don’t offer a refund in any case. We were really annoyed as we just purchased that few minutes ago and the people who sold it to us should have mentioned the weather. Also while we were waiting to request the refund the employee sold the same tickets to a family and didn’t say a word. We took the matter to the customer service and after a long conversation they were sincerely apologetic and said that the employees should have told us in advance. They offered us coupons and stickers to our little one and we tried to get the most out of it, and visit all the indoors ride and shows. The storm passed 1.5hr later and we managed to get on in most of the rides!!! The express pass is really expensive but it’s worth the time you spend waiting at the queue. We had a great day!

kyky752018,3.0,"May 7, 2019",Not as good as we had hoped,"We visited Universal on a Monday. We purchased standard tickets and hoped that being a Monday it wouldn't be too busy. We were wrong! From around lunch time even the kids rides had a wait of close to an hour. Like may other people have said, it's extremely hot in Singapore so waiting around in the heat for close to an hour for a ride that only goes for a minute or 2 is ridiculous, especially with kids. The park is small in size, so it doesn't take long to get around. Attendants at the rides had no personality and moved so slow getting people on and off rides. If it was managed better I'm sure the wait times would have been halved. Most of them seemed to be so unhappy with their jobs, no smiles or happy faces. We would have been able to get on more rides with the fast track tickets, however the cost on this day was the same price as a ticket $70SGD pp which was more than we wanted tp spend, so we just raced around as soon as we got into the park to get as much doon as fast as we could. We watched the Sesame Street show, I would recommend for 0-5 years, WaterWorld Show was good, but very very very hot sitting around. We also watched Shrek 4D which was good even though our chair broke 1/2 way through! We left the park at lunch time and got a pass out as there were many well priced restaurants (including McDonalds) a whort walk away. Overall I was disappointed with USS, I'm not sure if I would recommend this theme park to family and friends.

Since we visited on Saturday so we had option to stay until 10 PM night. The first thing is there are some online options available to buy tickets so explore that and you may get 10% discount. If you want to cover all rides. Either you start as early as 10 AM in the morning or else you buy express pass. For 1-2 minutes ride you may have to wait for an hour or so. The Roller Coaster was amazing. I had tried the Cyclone one. There is another roller coaster related to transformer. That can also be experienced. We watched some animated movies which was amazing and those were must watch. It is good to visit this place the day when it is not very hot as you have to walk in open area. You should spend time in the evening also to see the effect of lights. Some of my conclusions about Singapore Universal studios are as below.  1. The Size of this Studio is relatively smaller than US. 2. Number of rides are less. 3. The tickets are relatively cheaper. 4. The age of the kid should be more than 6 to enjoy this place. 5. If you are having great flair for Roller Coaster then you should visit this place. If not you can avoid this place.  Overall a nice Place. If you have sufficient time while in Singapore. This should be one of the top 10 item to visit.,Universal Studios Singapore
Rajeebg,4.0,"May 6, 2019",Excellent aura and the essence of Tourism,It’s great to be part of USS; they have it all to be an attraction on its own; wings of time and Waterworld were good and edgy . No point comparing as they have to be branded separately,Universal Studios Singapore
Naveen kumar G,3.0,"May 6, 2019",Needs a lot of improvement to keep its image,"Visited universal studios with family. We are very exited to see the place and probably have been planning for 3 months to visit this place. While there is no complaint on actual rides or the shows... i felt the owners are in the business of money minting rather than providing entertainment :( Let me share my experience:  we reached the universal studios at 9:30AM, the gates open at 10AM, each line has already a que of 30 - 40 people standing and waiting.  @10AM they opened the doors, we first entered madagaskar, first two of my rides are done with 10 mins waiting. @11AM we entered the jurassic park, for the boat ride we entered the queue, it took 1 hour 10 mins for us to get in to a ride of 3 minutes , By this we already tired of standing a long queue and its 12:30 by the time we finish this. Later we went to Egyptian theme (Revenge of the mummy), the board said it has a wait time of 120 Mins :( At this time we checked few other places, every where the minimum standing time in queue is more than 80 Minutes :( Horrible  Later we went to lights camera action, we stand in queue for 15 mins, while the show is good...  The major problem for the entire US is long wait times.even after one spending $75 you have to wait for 1 - 2 hours for your favorite ride, in reality you won't be covering more than 4 - 5 rides on a peak day and is total waste of money and time.  Just to add pain to the wound, they have an express line which they charge another $70 or so where you get direct access to the rides.. ( nice way to mint more money .. by making every one stand for hours and than collect extra amounts for faster access)  By the way, i rate very high about quality of shows and rides (you enjoy them)  Overall, Before my trip, i was super exited about this, but after visiting this actually i felt it is a total money minting machine.",Universal Studios Singapore

Jas,5.0,"May 5, 2019",One of my favorite place in the world,I just loved universal from the roller coasters to the 4D movies to live performances everything about this place is perfect  A couple of things to do to make your day even better  Make sure to carry some food in your bag cause the food inside is super pricey Buy your tickets before hand or else you'll have to wait in the que to buy tickets outside universal Get there by 10 am sharp so you can maximize your time inside (it closes at 8pm) Rides can take a lot of time even upto 2 hours so it's better to do single rider lane where you'll only have to wait for 5-10 minutes per ride or else you'll have to shell out extra for express entry  Tickets are for ₹3700 (54$),Universal Studios Singapore
Nikhil Kumar,5.0,"May 5, 2019",Visit to universal studios Singapore,"Magnificent experience . many rides which old people can also enjoy like Jurassic Park.

Dds,4.0,"May 5, 2019",Great for family outing,"If you have been to other Universal Studios, you will find this one small. Weekends especially Public Holidays are jammed packed so if you have the budget, I’d definitely recommend the express pass to skip the terribly long queues so you’ll be able to enjoy every attraction they have to offer ie: 4D movie/live action/each thrill/ride/adventure etc. in a breeze! Tickets can be purchased online in advance with/without hotel packages.",Universal Studios Singapore
PreetiAswal,5.0,"May 5, 2019",Fun filled time,Booking of ticket....online site klook etc. Reach half an hr before.Save money n walk down to Sentosa Island.We took metro card wh came handy in our stay in Singapore.Loved even bus services in between our stay. So reach till vivo mall n walk to Sentosa quite comfortable as walking acclerator in between...even kids seven plus it was comfortable.Now once u enter. ..do transformer...cyclone n human ride first as afterwards it's crazy. ...n walk after that in circle.....check if Ur kid can do it......than its easy to cover . ......keep full day for it . ..as till last you will be sweating only to complete something more.enjoy fun for family n kiddos.we all loved it.,Universal Studios Singapore
Aryan2007,5.0,"May 5, 2019",Tons of fun for all age groups !!,"We spent one entire day from morning 9 am to night 11 pm at the Universal Studio !!! We were advised by our travel agent to ensure that we take the Express pass and we were delighted to have done so !! It actually saved us a lot of time and we didnt have to go through the agony of waiting in long never ending Qs forever !!! We had gone to Universal around New year and the crowds were over whelming. Without the Express pass we would not have been able to cover all the rides and some even multiple times. My personal favorite were the Transformers, Steven Spielberg show, Gallactica roller coaster and the Jurrasic park theme rides. We also experienced the fireworks at 11 pm and the parade in the evening. Overall its was one of the most expensive day for us but worth every Dollar spent.",Universal Studios Singapore
Lyn E,3.0,"May 5, 2019",Be prepared to queue for every ride,Busy and crowded. Walking on bitumen or concrete walkways is hot and drains your energy. The out door rides close down if there is thunder and a chance of lightning- which is almost every day at some stage. The rides are however excellent- especially the 3D Transformers ride. Fantastic!!,Universal Studios Singapore
lkamphuis,5.0,"May 4, 2019",Express pass is a MUST,Luckily for us I had checked some reviews on trip advisor and every one said to buy an express pass- yep a MUST!!! Unless you want to wait up to two hours in the heat for the good rides ! It’s not a massive park - with 7 worlds and some of this only catering for small children ! BIG rides are Battle star galactica roller coasters (2) Revenge of the mummy Transformers And it’s HOT,Universal Studios Singapore
Vidit K,4.0,"May 4, 2019",Best in singapore,"If u have young children , the best part would be visiting this place . It was the best thing our kids would have wanted , all rides are different. Water world : must see show Shrek 4d : must see Mummy world roalercoster : I loved it as it has suspense, don't ever miss this . Transformers: must go 2 huge roaler coasters : must go  The only thing I didn't like is , it too small and way less rides .",Universal Studios Singapore
Simon Lasscock,4.0,"May 3, 2019",An ok experience,"Went to Universal studios on a Monday and it seemed less crowded than the weekend . I did not buy the express pass however this would have been useful on the majority of rides. The rides were ok but it is a very small universal studios park . There was only perhaps 12-14 rides of which only 4 were easy to get access to with the standard pass . If going there on a weekend or with children , then I would buy the express pass . The park was very clean and there was a lot of food options . There is not a lot of shade or shelter in the park and so I would recommend that you don’t visit in the middle of the day . Overall it was a good experience.",Universal Studios Singapore
Neisha D,4.0,"May 3, 2019",Great fun!,"This was good fun for us and our 8yo although the Transformers ride was too scary for her, we loved it. The Mummy ride was great as well as was the Waterworld show. These 3 rides were the highlight for us. We didn't try the big coasters as I don't have the stomach for it. We arrived right on 10 and our strategy was to visit the park anti clockwise. We didn't have to queue very much for any ride (max 20 mins). My tip is that if you have very young children go clockwise, if you don't go anti clockwise. We didn't eat in Universal- right outside is the Malaysian Street food hall where you can get really tasty, cheap (under $10) meals.",Universal Studios Singapore
StefaniaSss,1.0,"May 3, 2019",A completebwaste of money. Very very bad,"The queues were unbelievable. We started with madagascar where the queue was 60-70 min for a ride of under 5 min which was cheap and lack immagination. Cheap decor and zero effects aparts from 2 splashes of water. Next one was jurrasic boat with waiting of almost 2h for a ride of under 5 mins with nothing exciting, again water splash. The con is they obligate you to pay extra. For example the mummy rollercoaster: to buy the locker as you can.t take the rucsac and the waiting was almost 2h with 10 SGD per hour for locker. Again rip off. We went off peak with such huge queues for everything. The food is verry terrible in all places and some accept only cash. Toilets are disgusting. Overall worst ever spent 75 dollars",Universal Studios Singapore
Alexey Antropov,3.0,"May 3, 2019",US parks are better,"Attractions have long queues, even if you have taken “express” passes. You easily can lost up to 20 minutes in express lines! At some attractions express pass doesn’t work at all😮 I don’t remember such state of affairs at Orlando or at LA. In addition, there are very hot and stuffy in Singapore, and lines don’t have air conditioning and even have a lack of ventilation sometimes. The park is smaller than american ones. So, If you have been in US parks you will be disappointed.",Universal Studios Singapore
119shamin,5.0,"May 3, 2019",Awesome rides,"Mostly great fun at Universal Studios. Though the queues are very long, the rides are spectacular and both my sons aged 6 and 10 enjoyed it. We had the most fun at the Jurassic park and the Transformers. We even queued for a second round of rides and no matter how many times you go them, they are as thrilling as the first. Be prepared to get wet on some rides.  Shops are good, with wide range of themed items.Food is limited and very pricey. You need to get an early start at the theme as it will become crowded.",Universal Studios Singapore
Lidia M,4.0,"May 3, 2019",Great fun with just the right entertainment,We knew this was open until late so we entered in the late afternoon around 5pm where it wasn't too crowded and still quite warm but not stinking hot. There is an opportunity for the young and young at heart. It's not massively big but fun.,Universal Studios Singapore
datin_tan,3.0,"May 3, 2019",Visited on monday but long q everywhere,Our second time visit to the theme park. Thought Monday will be a good day to visit . We reached the entrance by 9.30 but there were already long lines at the entrance. We finally entered the park at 10.15 but most trill rides were full with load of ppls. We only managed to play only 4 rides and 3 shows which is totally out of our plan. Food and drinks are expensive. Each meal easily cost you sgd 14 and drinks at least sgd 4. I don't think I will visit the place again in the next 10 years.,Universal Studios Singapore
Polyester,5.0,"May 3, 2019",Lots of fun for both adults and kids.,"The best thing we did was pay extra for Express passes. Very hot to stand in long ques without them.. Those who wanted to, went on every ride they wanted to without having to que. Can also get a pass out, return to hotel for a swim. Also suggest much easier to stay on Sentosa as long ques for Monorail.",Universal Studios Singapore
KiwiTravellers18,4.0,"May 2, 2019",Fun day out,"Mostly great fun. Like any attraction of this nature there were large queues, but the rides were enjoyable. Our kids even lined up for a second run at a couple of them. Loved the shows, Marilyn and her crew were superb. Minions and Gru were especially fun to get photos with. Food wasn't great, limited choices and very pricey. Shops were generally good, with a wide range of themed items.",Universal Studios Singapore
Richard C,1.0,"May 2, 2019",Overrated and poor - a real disappointment,"Unfortunately this park is nowhere near as good as Disneyland - whether it be Hong Kong or California. The rides were weak, too short, the queues enormous unless you paid an extra $100 SD for the express queue.  There are few staff around. The food is overpriced, there is little shade from the 32 deg C heat.  The live shows were a poor cousin to the Disney ones. And the prices were considerably more.",Universal Studios Singapore

Krazz,4.0,"May 2, 2019",Great park but check the weather!,"The park is similar to the US one, but I liked that the Mummy ride and Jurassic Park rides routes and set were different, so that was something new. Loved the Cylon roller coaster - highly recommended for thrill seekers. Only thing to look out for is the weather as it rains quite often. The morning I got there, it was raining heavily and I still went in. The indoor rides will still work when it rains and the outdoor rides will only work when the weather gets better. Make sure to go there on a less rainy day. Luckily, the rain had subsided by the afternoon and we could go on all the rides in the end.",Universal Studios Singapore
LJB610,3.0,"May 1, 2019",Good effort but falls short,"If you have visited Universal in the US, don't expect the Singapore version to be the same. Good for a day out but falls short of the US locations. It is of course much smaller and the rides seemed 'tamer' than the US versions. The more mature staff are polite and helpful but the younger (entitled) generation seem to have the opinion the park is there to provide them with a job,not for them to provide great customer service. Take note Universal, your younger staff need a lot more lessons in customer service. The park is on Sentosa Island and getting here is relatively simple using the cable car, light rail,bus, car or taxi. Being smaller there are fewer attractions and rides but you will still need the better part of a day to get round everything. Singapore is a very popular tourist destination so worth the extra charge for the ""Fast Pass"" or Universal Express as they are called here. There are the usual gift shops and many food and beverage options to chose from within the park. Not brilliant but a fun day out.",Universal Studios Singapore
Epeniche,4.0,"May 1, 2019",It’s never too late 😉,"We have visited US Singapore several times and is always a good experience, however my kids are growing and the quantity of attractions for middle age kids are not that many, certainly is nice for few hours but not for the entire day as it is on the American parks.",Universal Studios Singapore
Rajesh Kumar P,5.0,"May 1, 2019",Start early in morning can finish it in a day,The best attraction in singapore .. This will open at 9am make sure you are at gate 9am so that you can finish in one day .. Don’t miss the transformers and mummy rides. There will be one water world live show at 2pm or 4pm don’t miss it,Universal Studios Singapore
NandanRao,5.0,"May 1, 2019",Full day fun,"Although not as big as the US in Los Angeles, the Singapore version packs enough fun for the whole family for a day.  We went during a week day expecting less crowd, but were surprised with the amount of people and decided to purchase the Express tickets (best decision). This saved us hours of queuing time and allowed us to visit all the attractions.  The highlight of the park is the HUMAN Vs CYLON.  CYLON is the most thrilling of the rides and along with my son, we had the most fun in this ride. Make sure that you wait for an extra turn to take the front row seats as this provides the maximum thrill especially when it accelerates fast and dives down. This ride involves sudden acceleration, fast dives and 5 times in the ride it goes upside down. Make sure that the stomach is empty before this ride  HUMAN on the other hand is a bit subdued with no 360 degree rotation. It is much doable for those afraid of the roller coaster rides.  The other rides worth doing (In the order of preference) - Transformers the ride - Mummy - Lost world Rapids adventure (You will be soaked) - Shrek 3D - Puss in the Boots - Lights camera Action  The only show that is worth seeing (Must do) is the water world show next to the Jurassic world. Show timing is at 4:30pm. Make sure to arrive at 4:10pm to get the best seats.  Overall a fun filled day and based on the crowds, it is worth buying the express pass. Food is expensive inside and Louis pizza is recommended. There are many places to fill water bottles and lockers near the Mummy ride are free for 45 minutes.",Universal Studios Singapore
Gabrielle B,4.0,"May 1, 2019",day out with kids and adults,"The whole family, 15 of us went to Universal studios for the day. We thoroughly enjoyed the rides although the queues were long. We were expecting to see the Harry Potter ride but it wasnt there. My kids had great joy in hearing me scream on the Transformer ride. We waited 1 hour to get on which was extrememly frustrating.",Universal Studios Singapore
nehas,5.0,"April 30, 2019",The fun day,"Right from getting up to getting ready,we did everything early that day,so that we could reach the studio by 9:30 am.So,the studio doors open at 10 am and people start queuing up some 45 mins to 1 hour before that.  A few pointers - Reach early,try to plan the universal trip on a weekday, weekends r crazy.  As soon as you enter,no matter how tempted you are to click pictures,but start with the rides first,as the queues (per ride) may get bigger,if u get late for the rides.  The rides we did as per the different zones were - 1) Sci fi zone - Transformers 3D ride (the perfect start to an adventurous day) 2) Sci fi zone - Battlestar Galactica Human (Cyclon is one notch up) n we totally enjoyed the scare,the shouts n the adrenaline rush. 3) Mummy zone - Revenge of the mummy (Dark n scary) 4) Jurassic Park - Rapid Adventure 5) Water world show (if you are looking at a play with lots of Bollywood action) After lunch break - 6) Jurassic Park - a roller coaster ride (don't remember the name of this ride specifically) 7)Far far away - Shrek 4D (our daughter enjoyed it but it was an ok experience,can be missed if you try the puss in boots ride) And rest all the rides after this seemed repetitive.  So,we were done by 4 pm,which gave us enough time for the clicks and souvenir shopping which my daughter wanted to do.  There are water stations at regular intervals,so water can be refilled and enough food joints. Keep some time to roam around the place (every nook and corner),they have decorated it so well,inside out.  In all,we had a fun filled day with lots of good memories.",Universal Studios Singapore
genuine_saj,5.0,"April 29, 2019",Good day out,"Rides i would recommend for the thrill seakers are Transformers, cyclone, human and galactica. The shows are good. Not as nice as Orlando but definatly a good day out.",Universal Studios Singapore

Fook L,2.0,"April 29, 2019",Theme Park???,"It has been a big disappointment bringing my guests to Universal Studios Singapore. Especially having the experience in other theme parks outside of Singapore. It was a demoralising start. The signage showed wait-time at Galactica ride to be 70 minutes, but we were caught in the queue for 120 minutes before we could take our ride. Even simple rides like Treasure hunt has queue time of 30 minutes displayed. Our experience suggested to us that we should not trust the signage as we waited longer than what was stated. We spent more time in the queue than enjoying ourselves on the rides. Just because we did not buy ""express"" tickets, cannot be used as an excuse to make us wait longer than what was projected.  The services are closed to non-existent. The service staff lacked charisma and ushered us as if we are on a bus-ride.  I will definitely not bring my guests to visit Universal Studios Sentosa if there is no compelling reason to do so.",Universal Studios Singapore

Rizvin,5.0,"April 29, 2019",VIP experience - The best way to experience USS,"We visited Universal Studios Singapore in April 2019. Since we had limited time and also 2 kids along with us, we decided to book the VIP experience. Even though it was way beyond our budget, it was one of the best decisions we made.  VIP experience is a 5 hours guided tour of USS covering almost all the rides and zones along with a guide and the best part is we get priority entry everywhere. We are literally treated as VIPs.  As per the instructions shared during our booking, we reach USS 15-20 mins before the tour started. In our case the tour was scheduled to start at 10:00 AM. We were introduced to our guide Jethro and he was an amazing person. He explained to us the various zones in the park, asked our preferences and planned the entire tour in such a way that we have the best experience without missing any of the rides or shows.  As mentioned earlier, we got priority entry to almost all the rides and shows, watched the Waterworld stunt show from an exclusive airconditioned viewing room, front row seats to all rides and shows, food coupons, special tags, badges, etc.  Jethro made our trip to the USS absolutely amazing and we enjoyed the entire experience without getting tired or losing time waiting in queues. Thank you so much Jethro. You are a rockstar!!!!!  The VIP experience is definitely a must do and you will never regret the extra money shelled out.",Universal Studios Singapore
Scott M,5.0,"April 29, 2019",Great fun and plenty to do.,"Attended on a Saturday as it is open until 10pm and ends the day with fireworks. Invested in 2 x Universal Express passes ($S90 each). These proved invaluable and ensured that we waited no more than 20 minutes in a queue for the rides so I recommend the investment if you are wanting to spend the day on the rides. Huge down pour an hour before the gates opened which must never deterred people from coming as the place didn't seem too busy or crowded. There are free lockers for between 45 or 105 minutes (free period depends on the length of the queues at the relevant rides) otherwise it is up to $S20 for the day. Lucky enough to go on about 30 rides as the express pass lines were not more than 20 minutes, most rides we were able to get on straight away. Plenty of food options available however most were closed due to the smaller crowds and I assume the weather but still plenty of choice. Otherwise, get a pass out and go the the food options outside the park. Fireworks were ok without being spectacular but worth waiting for and a good way to close out the day. The weather improved throughout the day so my 13 year old son and I have a great time. Would return again and would also purchase the express passes as they save so much time in queues, even if they cost more than the entrance fee!!.",Universal Studios Singapore

Michael,3.0,"April 28, 2019",Not convincing,"We went there on a rainy weekday, ie there were not so many people (which is good). If you dont like roller-coasters, then the Universal Studios might be a bit boring. There are many different themes (from Egypt to Jurassic Park), but in the center of all themes are roller-coasters and souvenir shops. That gets a bit boring, especially if you dont really like roller-coasters. In summer time when there are long queues, it might be disappointing to queue for 1+ hour for a 5-10 minute ride, only to queue at the next attraction. So overall, its nice to have been there, but no „must“ in Singapore.",Universal Studios Singapore

lauraarn,4.0,"April 26, 2019",Great day out!,"We had a fab family day at USS yesterday. There are a good range of rides to suit all ages- if you are after pure Adrenalin then you might get bored as only 4 key rides but for us with kids 3 and 6 the mix was perfect. We didn’t need the express pass as it was raining so less people but I’d suggest on a busy day this would be well worth it. It’s also over a small space which is great as not too much walking for the little ones. They also keep the park open late on Friday and sat and it was literally empty - no queues above 5 mins for anything so strongly suggest you stay til the evening if you can. Waterworks stunt show was amazing, well worth seeing. Cyclone is the best rollercoaster I’ve ever been on!",Universal Studios Singapore

Do not miss the Waterworld show and if it's a hot day sit in the middle in the blue zone down the front. Food and drink prices weren't too over the top by Australian theme park standards.

AdeenaAmatulHaqq,5.0,"April 26, 2019",Awesome Day!,"Husband and I visited on the 24th December. Holiday time so As expected it was pretty bus, queue times were long especially on the rollercoasters and popular rides such as the River Rapids and Transformers. I suggest getting to the park early and RUNNING to your first ride and youll save yourself an hour. If you want to skip the queues but don't want to pay for fast track tickets, head there AFTER 4-5pm; we actually got on more rides after this time then we did the whole day before - literally the rollercoaster queue times were under 30 minutes by the evening time, as opposed to 120-180 min. If you have bags put them in an all day locker at the lockers next to River Rapids ride in Jurassic area; don't fall for the timed lockers next to the rollercoasters because you'll likely overrun your tine and pay extra - seriously just get an all day locker or take nothing with you. Oh and another tip, bring a water bottle with you, even when queuing for rides, alot of the long queues can be agonising in Singapore heat and the A/Cs aren't great - i saw many people just putting their bottles or glasses on the other side of the ride platforms but DO NOT take your full bag in the queues or you'll be sent away disappointed.",Universal Studios Singapore
Mich W,4.0,"April 26, 2019","Great day out, glad we bought the express pass","We didn’t buy the express pass initially thinking that the queues wouldn’t be too long on a Monday, but we quickly changed our mind after entering! Even though it was expensive, it was so worth it as the queues were 45 min to an hour long and the express pass meant we didn’t have to wait for anything longer than 10-20 min, allowing us to squeeze more rides and activities in. Our 6 year old loved the park and went on about 8 rides/activities. There was less to do for our 3 year old so she didn’t enjoy it as much. The transformer 3D ride was our 6 year old’s favourite. Overall a great day out.",Universal Studios Singapore

The lines can get quite long, especially with young kids. Food and Drink is very expensive in the park, be prepared and take stuff with you.",Universal Studios Singapore
Exploration824877,5.0,"April 25, 2019",Five stars,"We live on the Gold Coast qld - theme park capital of Australia - and we were totally blown away by Universal studios! Everything feels new, clean, efficient - maybe we got lucky but the day we went the park seemed to handle the large crowds very easily! Most importantly there is something for every age bracket! Will be back again.",Universal Studios Singapore
The Traveller,5.0,"April 25, 2019",Loved it!!!,"Absolutely loved Universal Studios. There is soo much to see and do. We went on a weekday which was recommended by a local and it was relatively quiet. We ended up going right and hitting the major rides first (Transformers, Humans vs Cyclops, Return of Mummy and Jurrasic Park Rapids and caught the Watertown show at 12.30). We are soo thankful we did all this first as the major rides were well over an hour from 12.30 to 4.30. We just did the other zones in between and went back to the major rides later in the day. Food is ok but most places are $16 a dish/combo. You can get $3 refills from your cups so make sure you keep them. Souvenirs as expected are expensive but that is expected at a place like this. Have fun and try and do as much as you can!",Universal Studios Singapore
Beby4Jenny,5.0,"April 25, 2019",Awesome with grandchildren!!,Universal studios is a must see awesome destination if you are with kids. This place really rocks for kids and they really enjoyed all rides and shows which they got connected to the place. Indeed a please surprise to enjoy being there for 50th Anniversary.,Universal Studios Singapore
Gail B,5.0,"April 25, 2019",Loved Universal Studios,The Transformer ride is the best we’ve been on so good we went on it 3 times!! Great range of rides for younger kids to older kids/adults. We got VIP passes but probably didn’t need it on most rides. Had a great time.,Universal Studios Singapore
dave r,5.0,"April 25, 2019",Awesome,Great afternoon of rides. Get a priority pass means you miss all the lines. Was about $40 but definitely worth it. Loved it.,Universal Studios Singapore
JayMo,5.0,"April 24, 2019",Perfect sized park for a day trip,"I went on a Monday, and paid for an unlimited skip the queue tag. As it wasn’t school holidays, I probably needn’t have if I’d really wanted to save the cost, as the longest queue I saw whilst there was about 15 minutes. I really enjoyed The Mummy coaster, as it’s air conditioned and a fun ride to do over and over and over when it’s hot. I also really enjoyed Humans and Cylons, which are certainly thrilling if not a little shorter than expected. The very best aspect of this delightful park, which has fun rides for all ages, is its size. You will not find yourself exhausted trekking from zone to zone or ride to ride. Highly recommended.",Universal Studios Singapore
Bella Quince,5.0,"April 24, 2019",A day of fun and laughter in Universal Studios,The place is full of fun and adventure. It will bring out the kid in you. Be ready for an extreme fun and be amazed with the adventures you’ll experience.,Universal Studios Singapore
Naziha Ibrahim,5.0,"April 24, 2019",Amazed by the staff hospitality,"We are there the whole day enjoying all the attractions. We took VIP package so therefore we don't really que. Obviously this part of the world is hot and humid and not being on que really help us. For the Waterworld show, we are seated in the VIP room with AC which is very cozy and we enjoyed the show. The attractions are themed accordingly and staff are entertaining. Basically the whole visit was an enjoyable visit.",Universal Studios Singapore
Evalu8,4.0,"April 24, 2019","Don’t expect identical to the USA, but still fun","Maybe not as big as your US counterparts, but a good emulation all the same. The rides are fewer, it still with the regular showstoppers. The lines can be quite big during peak periods, so maybe consider a skip the line pass, but as we went mid week it wasn’t too bad. We had hoped to spend all day here, but after about 4hrs we had been on most rides and felt we had done all we wanted to do. There is also a stunt show which lasts about 30 mins which was a similar format to those we had seem before, but fun all the same. Well worth a visit.",Universal Studios Singapore
the_inquisitive,5.0,"April 24, 2019",Just loved it!,"Amazing place to be with your children. Went on Friday so got to see the parade and extra time to finish off the rides which was a bonus. Was a little confused if to buy the express pass, and would have been clearly a waste of money as most rides had only 5 min of waiting time by evening. You will need full one day to enjoy all the shows and rides. Food is a bit expensive.",Universal Studios Singapore
Mathew H,4.0,"April 24, 2019",Best Roller Coaster,"Spent the day at Universal Studies, Singapore, and had a ball. We got there early and managed to get on almost every ride, many more than once.  Most of the rides have been around for a few years so it was a bit of a repeat from our trip 4 years ago, but the Rollercoasters were new and a lot of fun.  We went with two adults and two kids (15 and 12). The best rides were, in order, the Ceylon Rollercoaster, transformers ride, hi an rollercoaster and the Mummy Rollercoaster.  Pretty good range of food. Prices are OK - what you would expect at any theme park.  My tip is to avoid long lines for the biggest rides by waiting until around 4pm. You will wait around 10-15 minutes and be able to have multiple rides in a short period. Just monitor the times from around 3pm.",Universal Studios Singapore
Matthew C,4.0,"April 23, 2019",Universal Studios Singapore,The universal studios gets very busy so it is best to get there early. The are extremely long and some rides are very short and not worth the wait. There is also a express pass which costs more than the normal one but gives you express access.,Universal Studios Singapore
Misha Z,5.0,"April 23, 2019",Amazing!,"A little bit expensive but it worth it as it is for all day! Lots of nice facilities and some of them were completely amazing! I think it is important to take express if there are long queues, otherwise, it is a long wait of 40-80 minutes for each facility, with express it took us about 5-15 minutes so that we managed to do many things.",Universal Studios Singapore
TheLcFamily,5.0,"April 23, 2019",A definite must do!,"Last time we came we lined up for 2hrs 45mins for Transformers ride, so this time we swore we'd get fast passes. We didn't BUT we got there nice and early and were prepared. We got to Vivo City at 8:40am and waited until 9am for the Sentosa counters to open. We bought our tickets there so when we got over we could go straight in. We got there first thing and waited by the gates. We were first in line when it opened at 10am. They do a little intro and they had a thing where the most enthusiastic patron won express passes. My son was lucky enough to win, so he got 5 fast passes for any ride for the day. 1 time use. So when we got in we ran straight to the Transformers ride and got straight on. We then managed to go on most rides and got you the Waterworld Show for 12:30. A must see show! Then we had lunch at Mels Diner where they had awesome Elmo Burgers, that actually tasted amazing, and Cookie Monster shakes! Then we had the longest wait for any ride, 1hr 30mins for the Human roller coaster. We had gone to go earlier but it was closed for technical issues. So we lined up but right as we got to the top they closed it again. We took the gamble to wait and we waited a further 20mins at the top to get on. A little annoying was once the ride was up and going again they had reopened the line downstairs so all these fast pass people got straight on and the people who had loyally waited out the technical issues waited even longer. But overall, it was a great day! We went on a Thursday , as apparently weekdays are quieter. Friday, Saturday nights it's open later but you run the risk of it being busier. Don't think about it, just go!!",Universal Studios Singapore
Grant Keri,5.0,"April 23, 2019",So much fun!,Loved universal studio so much fun. Take plenty of sunblock and wear easy dry clothes as there are a few wet rides/ activities. There are lockers to lock away your bags for the day. You do need cash for some of the food stalls. Really recommend sci fi city and the lost world for some adrenalin rides 😄.,Universal Studios Singapore
GrantSheridan,5.0,"April 23, 2019",Awesome day,"My girlfriend and I were like two big kids here. It's a great, clean fun park with enjoyable rides. We purchased the unlimited express pass that allowed us to skip the queue. If the waiting time for a ride was 60 minutes, the express queue was about a 15 minute wait at the most. The only thing we didn't like was the cost of food and beverages, very expensive. Overall we had a great day and highly recommend this place.",Universal Studios Singapore
Chelsea Reyes,5.0,"April 22, 2019",Memorable Experience ❤️,"My sister will never forget this because i treat her 😂 this is very special day of my sister and unforgettable experience specially the rides. 🎡 i buy my ticket in carousell for only $55, it was a great deal. But the food is expensive, but still the happiness will cover your pocket 😂",Universal Studios Singapore
Amy C,4.0,"April 22, 2019",Better than I expected for a group of adults: recommend the $30 express pass,"Good rides for adults: - the mummy (went on 3x!) - Sci Fi accelerator - the Human roller-coaster - the Cylon roller-coaster - transformers  Good shows for adults: - lights camera action - shrek  Tips: - buy the express pass ($30 for one use per attraction) - your shoes (and socks) will get wet on the Jurassic Park Rapids ride - try to eat before, a slice of pizza is $11 and a small bottle of water is $4 - they wouldn't let us bring in a bottle of water (unless you can hide it) - there are refill taps and drinking fountains everywhere  My two cents on the Express pass: I was originally against the express pass, seemed like a huge waste of money but after considering we were able to on ride within 0-20 mins instead of waiting 40-60 mins, it was well worth it. I went on a Monday and the average wait time for the popular rides I recommended was 60 mins, due to weather the roller-coaster wait time was 120 mins. In my opinion the unlimited express $70 isn't really needed, but the $30 limited pas is great value.  You can go into Universal Studios and check out the estimated wait times as you can buy the express pass at any time once you're inside anyway.",Universal Studios Singapore
Marwinkle1,4.0,"April 22, 2019",Great Day Out,"Great day to spend with the kids, albeit expensive. Good selection of rides and attractions for younger and older kids, as well as adults. Definitely worth paying the extra for express line. There were 3 of us so we bought 2 express line passes and the other person went in the single rider queue, saved hours queuing I reckon. Some of the times we all ended up together anyway as the third person was put in with us.",Universal Studios Singapore
SarahGkiwi,3.0,"April 22, 2019",Family visit,"A great day out for the family. Plenty of fun with roller coasters, Shrek animation, Transformers and the Jurassic Park ride. The park staff are friendly and helpful. Two areas they need to improve getting the waiting time right (always short by about 30%) and marking the waiting time out on the ground/wall or similar.  Our biggest mistake was not purchasing the ‘express tickets’ as these would have cut down the waiting times significantly (from about 50mins to 10mins apparently). Even though these are expensive, well worth it, especially when waiting in the heat.",Universal Studios Singapore
abhi9882,5.0,"April 22, 2019",Best tourist attraction of Singapore,Best tourist attraction of Singapore with lot of activities for both old and young ones .

SwissTraveler,3.0,"April 22, 2019",Good rides. Overpriced food and drinks,The rides are quite good but they rip you off with food and drink prices inside. Burger and Coke way below McDonald's quality costs you 20$. What a sad strategy.,Universal Studios Singapore

medha_pr,5.0,"April 22, 2019",Full Day is not enough to enjoy this,"Remember you need to spend full day here to experience this place. You obviously cannot finish all rides in a single day, so decide the ones you want to go based on thrill level and plan accordingly.  For sure one of the most touristy places in Singapore, hence the most expensive too. Remember to carry water bottle, they do have free water refiling stations.",Universal Studios Singapore

I will never forget this place because I rode my first roller coaster in there(which was an amazing experience). There was also a Broadway kinda show for new year celebration , the themed areas was all nice and I'll never forget the long wait lines (it's worth it). We were eating and drinking and having a good time. I highly recommend this place for visitors.",Universal Studios Singapore
Pauli,2.0,"April 21, 2019",Disappointing,"Queues for all attractions were long, so we gave most of the rides a miss. We queued for 30 minutes for Lights, Camera, Action, and its Category 5 Hurricane simulation. It was over within 2 minutes. We then queued for Donkey Live. I wish we hadn't. The show was cringeworthy at best. We all enjoyed the Shrek 4D Adventure. It was the highlight of our day in USS. The Madagascar River ride was poor. The Accelerator was enjoyable but over within 1 minute 40 seconds. Not long considering we queued for half an hour to get on it. That seemed to be the theme of our day, queue for ages for a very very short thrill or experience. Perhaps, it would have been more enjoyable if we would have purchased a fastrack pass, but that makes the day very expensive for a family of 4, and given the short duration of the rides and experiences, i don't think that expense would be justified.",Universal Studios Singapore
Salini,3.0,"April 21, 2019",Holiday,It's a fun place with lots of fast food restaurants and lots of fun for kids. Big Casino . It's got entertainment both for man and woman,Universal Studios Singapore
Squk,4.0,"April 20, 2019",The Wallet Crusher,Theme Parks are expensive but I have to say Universal Singapore have taken it to the next level with the costs they charge. From the Universal Express pass to the food inside. A family of 4 having burgers and chips will set you back US$50 plus the costs of drinks. An express pass will set you back US$40 per person and you can only use it once per ride. You can get a more expensive one for $60 if you so wish.  The rides are good but limited if you want extreme thrills. Good for children overall.,Universal Studios Singapore
Valentina Bianchi,4.0,"April 20, 2019",Experience enjoyed but a bit expensive for its worth,My friends and I enjoyed our experience at universal studios.

Simon P,4.0,"April 20, 2019",Fun but small,"We had a really good time, as lovers of theme parks we went and tried it out. It’s a bit expensive but really nice once you get in. If you like theme parks I would recommend, it’s a nice half day out",Universal Studios Singapore
John F,1.0,"April 20, 2019",Better Things To Do With Time And Money,Staff were efficient and friendly that is until you got through the turnstiles. Total lack of interest. I swear the girl on the stand outside the Rapids Adventure ride is a statue. Waiting outside the second ride of the day for family 2 hour wait. Interrupted by the visits to the loo after what was an expensive and unappetizing lunch. Seriously much better attractions and things to do in Singapore. And USS change your formulaic reply to all bad reviews. Show that you care about something you say you represent and genuinely do something about staff wait times or drop your price to free. I still would not bring my family back,Universal Studios Singapore
alhasan1909,5.0,"April 20, 2019",Kids Had a blast,"I'm writing this review as a parent. This is year we were lucky to go during The Chinese New Year they had special shows for CNY the Dragon Trail was loads of fun were a dancing dragon goes through all the Zones and the Characters from that zone came in and joined the Dancing. There was also the Hollywood Dreams Light Up Parade which the kids really enjoyed. We also went to the Sesame Street breakfast which is held every Saturday, the kids really loved the breakfast where they got to meet the Characters 1 on 1 which was an amazing. Yes it's expensive and the food might not be that great but if your visiting only once this is a great experience for kids. A special mention of all the staff who are professional, polite and very helpful. My kids had a great time do check out the Elmo TV funtime show which is really good.",Universal Studios Singapore

Sweetpkiwi,3.0,"April 19, 2019",Fun...but at a price!,"This is our second time to Universal. The first time we were disappointed as the two big rides were closed but my young boys loved the other rides and enjoyed the Waterworld show and got totally soaked!! It was a very hot day so, it was a bonus. This time we got to do most of the rides including the big rollercoasters and the queues weren't too long. Still we were disappointed with the food. It was so expensive and just terrible options. Ended up having burgers with black buns that tasted horrible. All the other options seemed to, pretty much, be Indian. Overall it was an expensive day out.",Universal Studios Singapore
Mustravel_365,2.0,"April 19, 2019",Not that good,In all honesty we could ditch this attraction and I wouldn’t think that I missed out on anything.  If you’ve decided to go definitely go in the afternoon when the waiting time is a bit less as the waiting time is minimum 60 minutes and OMG inside where you’re waiting is extremely hot some without any AC or fan. It was brutal.  We waited over an hour in that heat and the ride was only 1 minute 20 seconds 😳😳 I found it absolutely ridiculous 🤬  On top of that you have to pay for lockers to keep your stuff away. If you want to get the express pass it’s double normal price.  It was way too expensive for what it was and the rides weren’t that thrilling.,Universal Studios Singapore
AnotherUnitedKingdom,3.0,"April 19, 2019",Disorganised Fun,"Out of the 3 parks in world, this is number 3.  It’s pretty small and lacks most of the contemporary attractions. There’s no Harry Potter or adult themed rides beyond The Mummy (which is great). It is clean and well maintianed though.  The overall atmosphere is not one of joy or adventure - just random disorganised chaos. I think they could benefit from more staff on the ride entry areas and marshalling people generally. It’s common in Asia for there to very large organised groups moving around together and this is not helpful in a theme park setting.  It’s got some unique rides (the Jurrasic Park raft elevator and drop concept is cool) but the overall issue here is severe lack of crowd control and the whole queue management issue.  Be patient. Drinks lots of water and be prepared to wait. Even with a express pass.  Speaking of which - the express pass needs to be printed out so the ride staff can literally tick off (with an actual pen) which rides you’ve been on. It’s 2019. But go figure.  The staff are permanently having to repeat ‘use the lockers’ and ‘no bags’ to EVERY rider. There are no clear signs. The locker areas are small and chaotic. Be prepared to leave you stuff, no matter how small - so do all these rides in one maybe?  The big rides (BattleStar) only seem to have one set of cars running, so theres no way to speed up loading.  The number of rides breaking down or on hold was pretty high too.  So, yeah give it a go but have realistic expectations!",Universal Studios Singapore
Suhail Baker,1.0,"April 18, 2019",Not worth your time and money!,"Been there few times, each time leaving the park with Huge disappointment. Extremely Long snake like queues, never ending Queues ..queues as far as from Asia to Africa by foot, far far away .. queue as far as ancient Egypt. For 8 hours , you can get a maximum 4 rides , don’t you dare dream trying all the rides even if your are the guest to enter and the last to leave ..  Expensive food.. ordered 2 burgers and chicken nuggets at Mel Drive in for myself , my child and my Wife , cost us $55 and received the order in 15 seconds although there were no queues.. the meal arrived cold and soggy , when I requested for fresher and hot meals , the Indian staff wearing blue T-shirt, in his late 40s or early 50s, got really displeased and used his hand wearing blue glove which was used touching here and there , God knows what germs that filthy glove was holding .. changed the French fries only, when my Wife felt disgusted with the way he was handling our food,and asked what he was doing , he got frustrated and started arguing, we also received a surprise , a strand of hair in the red box which contained the fries ...duck duck duck , do we deserve to get treated for not able to enjoy the ride and paying exorbitantly high price for a crap meal ?",Universal Studios Singapore
Jen Moroney,4.0,"April 18, 2019",Get The Fast Pass,We loved our day at Universal Studios and I am forever grateful we brought the Fast Pass without it I’m not sure we would have gotten on half the rides we did. The Water World show would be one of the best shows I’ve ever seen and it is a must see. When you first enter rides there really isn’t a lot of information on what to expect which is exciting yet terrifying especially on the Transformers ride for kids! The Puss In Boots & Jurassic Park (get to this on early as the queues get huge!)rides are a must do for any family. As you would expect food is really expensive and make sure you take a lot of water!,Universal Studios Singapore
Sue,4.0,"April 18, 2019",Busy but good fun.,We've been to Universal in Florida and while the Singapore one is a lot smaller there are still some great rides and shows to see. Arrive early and ride the big rides first as these are really popular and the wait times can get very long. The Waterworld show is definitely worth seeing and you also get a seat in the shade for 30mins. The food is a bit mixed. We ate at Mel's Diner and the burgers were really good but with a fuzzy teenager the other options were slightly limited. He did however LOVE the churros!,Universal Studios Singapore

Mrs Tan,4.0,"April 18, 2019",Fun but not suitable for young children,"I'm a singaporean who decided to celebrate my birthday by bringing our young child to USS for the day.  First impression, the decorations are in line with the sesame street 50 birthday celebration.  Hearing from friends that the transformer 3d ride is very popular, we decided to go for it first, we were lucky that the queue took us around 15mins, which is still acceptable, as we were in time for our next planned show.  Enjoyed the Elmo TV show, saw our favorite characters, interesting presentation too.  After the shrek 4d, our young child seems pretty overwhelmed, refusing to go for any other rides the whole day, not even the the merry go round at the Madagascar.  Luckily, there are the sesame street birthday blowout and the Oscar trash beats to entertain us. We also get to sit and rest in the air_con emporium food court at new york, hiding from the heat several times without being thrown out.  Food: we had our lunch at the Mel's, a very expensive meal, $16 for a Elmo burger with fries and $16 a bacon beef burger with fries, $12 for a drink, in total spent $44 for just a simple meal. It was a hot day, with not much appetite, the 2 sets was enough for 2 adults and a child to share. Probably the staff would like to remind guests that the eyes and the nose on elmo is just printed paper and not edible. Our child took a bite on it, happily thinking it was chocolate.  Retail: The selection of souvenirs and toys are wide, prices are quite reasonable for some, especially the toys.  Restrooms and water coolers are quite accessible, despite the hot weather, we get to keep ourselves hydrated conveniently.  Overall, we had fun, and we were very glad that we had went for the transformer ride before our child freaked out. USS is probably not suitable for young children, more for the fun-loving teens.  By the way, we find that the quality of the 3d glasses at the transformers are very much better than the ones at shrek 4d, shrek ones are much more blurry.",Universal Studios Singapore
dealer1983,3.0,"April 17, 2019",Rather on the small side,Great place to visit if you are running out of things to do and see in Singapore. For the price we paid I was expecting alot more. Literally takes 10 minutes to walk all the way round the complex. We paid extra for Express passes which was pointless as the longest queue was only 10mins. Overall a good day out for young children as they get to meet alot of characters which you dont really get in the USA.,Universal Studios Singapore

Louise C,4.0,"April 16, 2019",Great but expensive,We had a really good day and the park is well designed so that you can move around it quickly. A good range of rides and activities and compared to some parks a variety of food options although few healthy ones. I would recommend you get to the park before choosing the fast pass option as queues were fairly short on the day we visited and would only have done 1 time only pass rather than multiple. Staff were enthusiastic and helpful even with some difficult audiences. All expensive but then that is Singapore.,Universal Studios Singapore

Nice place to take pictures, alot of shows, roller coasters, mascots and alot rides for all ages. But the only problem is, i think cant bring own food. And also the food drinks inside is expensive. Bring your own water bottle, theres couple of water cooler/dispenser for u to refill.",Universal Studios Singapore
kavie k,4.0,"April 14, 2019",Worth the visit,"It's not necessary to buy the express ticket as the queue was manageable, bout 15 mins each ride. Plus there is an option to ride as single riders too. The place brings out the child in you. Worth the time and money. Would repeat again.",Universal Studios Singapore
Tifani Marchell,4.0,"April 14, 2019",Amazing!,"I went to Universal Studio Singapore with my Husband.

Vijay t,5.0,"April 14, 2019",Fun day,"Nice place to visit and worth the money .. food at the restaurant not very great .. enjoyed All the rides especially mummy , Jurassic Park and transformers even though have to wait for 1 1/2 hour for Long que ..surely have to visit if u have children’s",Universal Studios Singapore
Flyer790301,5.0,"April 14, 2019",Worth a day,"I went to universal with my daughter after our Asian cruise. I am 68 and she is 41. She rode the roller coasters I people watched, we both did the slower rides which I loved, the park was spotless but the line ups horrendous so my daughter paid another $50 for an express pass to beat the ques and was worth it especially if you are limited for time enabling her to go on rides twice and get through the line the 1st time. Having been to universal California 35yrs ago we still remember but enjoyed universal Singapore because of all the new rides. You really need a day. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED.",Universal Studios Singapore
Philip in Oxford,5.0,"April 14, 2019",Fun day out!,"Having done Universal in Hollywood we went straight for the queue jump tickets. It saves so much queuing and simply allows you to get a full experience from the park.  If you like rollercoasters then head to the Battlestar Galactica rides. A twin rollercoaster with a Human and Cylon ride intertwined. The Cylon ride is a hanging ride and the more thrilling of the two.  Other notable rides are the Mummy, Transformers and the Jurassic Park water ride. Be prepared to get very wet! And I do mean that. The wrong shoe choice here means wet feet for the rest of the day!",Universal Studios Singapore
Inorbital,4.0,"April 14, 2019",Universal Express Pass,"Went there on Saturday, it was crowded as expected. So, we went straight to buy the unlimited express pass (SGD100) for unlimited express rides. If you buy standard express pass (SGD70), you can use it for 1 time per an attraction. Some of the attractions are worth for more than one ride. Mummy, Transformer, Cylon & Human Gallacticas are highly recommended!",Universal Studios Singapore
Bonza192,5.0,"April 14, 2019",Wow need lots of time,"Great rides, amazing shows. Must do waterworld show it was incredible with explosions and all.

StaceSabbagh,5.0,"April 14, 2019",Awesome Theme Park!,You need all day here! I loved this place so much! My husband and I enjoyed all the rides and we took millions of photos of everything. The mummy ride was the scariest. I loved the roller coaster. The Waterworld Stunt show is the best I’ve seen so far & Ive done so many theme parks. Would love to come back again one day.,Universal Studios Singapore
Sharon Ho,4.0,"April 14, 2019",Sci fi roller coasters repeats are must!,"For those with kids it's a great place to explore but one day may not be enough for all the play and theatre show plus adult rides.  For adults, all you need are scifi double roller coaster rides (u can literally repeat these two rides from human to cylon whole day long is good enough haha!).  Dont miss out on mummy indoor roller coaster ride (great ride must try! Can be scary even for kids age 9 and above due to the cinematic effects).  Jurassic world: the sky ride and rock climbing (over and over) but the water boat ride will just be for once experience will do. Just skip the long queue and head on to single person ride. It's quicker.  The puss in boot sky ride and the castle dragon roller coaster in the far far away castle are fun. Madagascar practically isn't for adults but the boat ride for the experience is not bad.  Transformer we didn't go but lucky as the motion sickness is bad according to friends who experienced it.  If you're lucky you get to watch the parade at 8pm on weekends!",Universal Studios Singapore
Foodislife,4.0,"April 14, 2019",Lovely Day,"Me and my friends had a blast here. The mummy a must try and ofcourse the roller coaster.

Rhys P,5.0,"April 13, 2019",Great family fun,Spent whole day there. Got to go on everything we wanted. Great in last 2 hours as becomes quieter so wait times minimal. Very hot but park does great job keeping cool in the queues. Everyone had their favourite rides but Transformers is unmissable,Universal Studios Singapore
NASu,5.0,"April 13, 2019",The best part of Singapore,Went with my teenage daughter & she had a blast. I had a blast watching her that ways. Don’t miss. If u ain’t too adventurous you could choose to skip few rides which may scare u ... but if u are a daredevil then go on a empty stomach to avoid throwing up.  Take an express pass & reach early if u want to complete the tour in one day. Have fun.  Don’t miss the coconut water they serve there ... never had anything like that in India.,Universal Studios Singapore
Mimz M,4.0,"April 13, 2019",The yearly pass is your cheapest option,"I like two games at this place — the roller coaster (make sure u go Blue, the Red will only make you sick) and the mummy!

It’s a fun place for everyone kids and adults.",Universal Studios Singapore
ShantelleP,5.0,"April 13, 2019",Worthwhile visit - thoroughly enjoyable,This is an awesome fun filled day out with something for everyone. Best rides were the 2 Battlestar Gallactica roller coasters but not for the faint hearted. Best to be at the park when the gates open and make a bee line for the rides that you want to do because the park gets busy and you can end up waiting up to an an hour for the more popular rides. Take sunscreen.,Universal Studios Singapore
sohil chawla,5.0,"April 13, 2019",Singapore Trip,"Fantastic place specially the transformer ride was out of the world. We did it thrice,mummy was good too. The jurassic park was a bit childish. But the shows are not to be missed, every show is the best.",Universal Studios Singapore

Azza_n_Kel,4.0,"April 13, 2019",Some decent attractions,We came here with a young daughter and unfortunately she was too little for a lot of the rides and experiences so she wasn’t able to get the amount of fun we thought she would get out of it but we still had a pretty fun time walking around and sightseeing so if you gonna be in Singapore definitely a place to see,Universal Studios Singapore
Travel529,4.0,"April 12, 2019",Decent attraction!,"If you have been to Universal Studios, LA, USA or Disneyland, USA & France, then this place wont fascinate you much. For decades everything is same nothing new, so don’t repeat it. Its a small Universal Studios and good for those who haven’t been to such place ever before. They have limited rides and some of the roller coasters don’t work, they give an excuse of technical problem. Buy express pass if you want to avoid standing in que for hours, no seating arrangement in que so sit on floor or stand and after waiting for hours the attaraction/ ride is hardly for 1-2 minutes. The food options are poor and disappointing when you pay so much, neither tasty nor enough food options. Just average attaraction to visit. Also, restaurant staff needs to be taught hospitality.",Universal Studios Singapore
Vin Dosa,5.0,"April 12, 2019",Truly beautiful experience!1,"Just a day here is not enough. One cannot get over with this just in day.

29samd,5.0,"April 12, 2019",Universal Studios is a great place to be!,"Last month I went to a place called Universal Studios that is in Sentosa. It is so stupefying and here are some reasons why. The first reason is that the food tastes amazing and it’s affordable. The second reason is the rides are really enjoyable that I think you should try it. For example, the Trasformers ride. You get to ride a car and the whole ride is 3D! Third reason is, they have lot’s of shows and most of them are for kids. I hope this is a good place for you now and I highly recommend it for kids but it may be better if you go as a family.",Universal Studios Singapore

Aparna S,5.0,"April 10, 2019",Great Fun. Not to miss at Sentosa,"USS is a must visit place especially if you are with kids, not that adults don't enjoy. I had told my kids to plan their USS trip and first thing they decided was to keep a whole day for USS. It's better if you visit on weekdays as it will save long ques. First do all the outdoor rides and the thrill rides and later go for indoor rides. Try to reach at 9 AM as there is a long queue to enter. Carry some snacks and water but preferably ride light. We all enjoyed Battlestar Galactica:Cylon, Transformer, Revenge of the Mummy, Jurassic Park. There are some shows going on. We liked Donkey show a lot. Steven Spielberg show was fascinating. Although it is said to be smaller than Universal Studios Hollywood its no less fun.",Universal Studios Singapore
HulaMN,5.0,"April 10, 2019",Fun day; Express pass worth buying at peak time,"We visited here for our teenage daughter's birthday. We purchased tickets and Express passes beforehand. We bought the Express tickets as we went on a Friday which is a peak day on Sentosa. We spent all day here.  Lots of good rides and a range of different types too. We have visited universal in Orlando and Los Angeles. This park is a little smaller and a little more compact but it is still a full day out.  The Battlestar coasters were great - two quite different inter-looped around each other. There was a lot we really enjoyed! The parade was fun too - different to those in the US, better infact.  Brilliant day.",Universal Studios Singapore
Bob A,4.0,"April 10, 2019",Great day out for the family.,We bought our tickets the day before our planned visit to avoid a queue which was a good idea. Universal was very entertaining and well organised throughout. The staff were very helpful too. Only one attraction had a large one hour queue which was the Rapids ride. Universal isn't that big and could all be done in a day. A great day out and very entertaining. I am only giving a 4 out of 5 as Universal in California deserved an excellent. So for no other reason. Well done!,Universal Studios Singapore
Ismael Malik,5.0,"April 9, 2019",Why you should visit Universal Studios,Last year I went to Universal Studios. It’s amazing!!! Because the roller coaster can go up and down. The biggest Roller coasters is the Battle Star Galactica. The Battle Star Galactica is recommended for older kids. Now go and have fun at Universal Studio.,Universal Studios Singapore
GourmandAus,3.0,"April 9, 2019",Small but with different attractions to the US counterparts,"A mini version of its larger (and original) siblings in the US, the rides are targeted to local/regional tastes but are still very well done. A little less movie magic (there is little by way of movie-making interaction) a more merchandising and amusement park. Most of the attractions (on a relatively quiet day) can be done in one day.",Universal Studios Singapore
JLOCLEOFE,5.0,"April 9, 2019",Our favourite US,One of the happiest place indeed for kids and kids at heart. It brings out the kids in us. Coming here is always a good choice. Line isn’t too long. You get to see and try most of the attractions and rides. Lots of food choices too. Worth of your money. Must visit when in SG.,Universal Studios Singapore
Lewis,5.0,"April 9, 2019",Brilliant day out!!!,"We had an exceptional day at Universal Studios and can highly recommend it. We got there for 10am and paid the extra for the fast-track passes and they were definitely worth it. All day we waited a maximum 5 minutes or so when we got to the front of each queue and it just made the day so enjoyable.  The rides themselves are varied and the park itself is relatively small so getting from one zone to another is very easy. Transformers, Cyclone, Jurassic Park Rapids, Human and The Revenge of the Mummy were by far the favourites and these are probably the ones most geared towards adults.  The other thing not to miss is the Waterworld live show- we ended up going twice it was that well done.  Can’t recommend it highly enough.",Universal Studios Singapore
anju_10,4.0,"April 8, 2019",Asian version of universal studios,"We had recently visited universal studios in USA , which was much larger in size.Due to space limitations in Singapore , it is set up in a smaller place.We loved different shows and rides.But lines were long for most of the popular rides. We had to upgrade our ticket by paying 50 dollars per head.They also had shut down the rides due to rain and thunder. Howevery family enjoyed rides and we had a full fledged day in the park.",Universal Studios Singapore
adrianhobson,4.0,"April 8, 2019",Small but perfectly formed,"It's small but there are some great rides and it should keep you happy all day. A few big rides but mostly family orientated. Really good ""live"" dinosaur event. Loved the canopy flyer. Also worth a mention was the Oasis Spice Cafe. Best smelling theme park counter service ever. Excellent Indian food for about S$15.  We got a big discount for being over 60 (about 50%) so take your proof of age.",Universal Studios Singapore
loladelorean,5.0,"April 8, 2019",One of our best ever theme park days - surpassed expectations!,"We had one of the best theme park days ever on our visit here - and we go to a lot of parks. The park is just the right size and seems to have the perfect amount of attractions for a single day. We went on everything we wanted, saw a couple of shows, revisited our favourite rides, and didn't wait more than 30 minutes for anything. The Cylon side of the Battlestar Galactica coaster is incredible! We were also super impressed with the Transformers ride, best 4D ride I've done, and with the Mummy. Waterworld show was fun, and we had really good lunch at the Egyptian themed place. The only ride that was slightly disappointing was the Puss in Boots coaster, it stops and starts too much and doesn't really succeed as either a thrill ride or a story ride as it tries to do both. The Shrek land is brilliant though, the castle is really big and the whole area has been themed well.",Universal Studios Singapore
Tarek K,4.0,"April 7, 2019",Convenient and great weather,They have adequate number of rides but they should get some of the new ones too and they also have nice roller coaster. Overall it’s a great place and must visit if you are in Singapore.,Universal Studios Singapore

louisej856,4.0,"April 6, 2019",Fun day out,"Not as big as the Universal Studios parks in Orlando or LA, but also not as expensive to visit (approx £45). There’s no Simpson’s World or Wizarding World of Harry Potter, but the Madagascar, Sheek and Science Fiction areas were all done really well. The Ancient Egypt set pieces were the best I’ve seen. There’s lots of great rides including Transformers 3D, The Mummy and the huge Battlestar Galactica rollercoaster. Plus gift shops and various places to eat. Give yourself 3-4 hours to see everything, and then take advantage of some of the other attractions on Sentosa Island.",Universal Studios Singapore
Koenraad P,4.0,"April 6, 2019",Great fun,"We visited this week 2 theme park with my daughter of 10, universal studio and legoland, my daughter is clear universal is her favorite, the rides are more fun, so if you have a 10 year old go universal if you kid is younger go legoland.  I think universal was a clean and up standard park, part from the food stalls where to much oriented on local taste and not to international taste!  The priority pass worked fine and with a 10 year old a delight and sure worth the money! Print the passes out as scanning over the phone does not works and only frustrate the scanner guys so paper give them a smile and helpful magic happens !!! Paper is key here!!!  We sure will be back here,... but our favorite is still Walt Disney Hong Kong just a touch more professional !",Universal Studios Singapore
Amanda,4.0,"April 5, 2019","Great amusement park, worth a visit","First of all, GET THE EXPRESS PASS. Otherwise you'll waste precious time waiting in line for the rides. Park wasn't crowded yet the waiting time was crazy long, for some rides 90minutes. So the express pass is well worth with the time you'll save. Great rides for everyone. Themes are well executed. Water show was crazy, a must see. Ok selection for food, a huge plus for the souvenir mug that came with the meal. All in all a day well spent.",Universal Studios Singapore
Maral.Vel,5.0,"April 5, 2019","Go on weekdays, loved it","We went there on a weekday (I think it was Monday), so we took metro till vivo city (HarborFront), climbed to 3rd floor (you will see directions). we bought tickets to monorail and entrance ticket for Universal Studios together. Cheaper to buy online I guess, but you can still get one in vivo city 3rd floor, or at the universal studios entrance. Try to visit some travel advisors located all around the city, they might give good advice: for example, they gave me the brochure with which we could save 10% from Studio's ticket. We were one of the first to arrive at the studio's entrance. A line gathered about 15 minutes prior to opening.Host at the entrance also gave one RED TICKET (I think it offers you to pass all lines and/or limitless rides) for the person who was the loudest. I didn't need it since I was with my husband and thought it was pointless to enjoy all the rides all alone. BUT you can make sure if it will help your partner or a child to pass along with you. Anyways,  this was our first visit to a park of this size and this fun. I've read many reviews saying that after Orlando this one looked lame. I've never been to Orlando, and we LOVED Universal Studios Singapore. Especially we loved the show Water World, LightsCameraAction! I even talked with Interactive Donkey from Shrek. That show probably mostly for children, but still fun. I didn't like much Jurassic period, because the boat was spinning all the time. and yes, you will get wet.  All in all, we loved our day, we were there until 16:00, but we loved all about it.",Universal Studios Singapore

Moira_Bannister,4.0,"April 3, 2019",Family holiday,This was our second trip to Universal studios and perhaps not the best idea in the world to go on the day you arrive after a 10 hour flight in the heat and humidity of Singapore. The facility is stunning and well maintained. We were slightly disappointed that after a 6 year gap there was really nothing new that we could find. The time counter on the queues was also way off and the Mummy appeared to give more problems than what it was worth. Loved the food court and all the attractions and well done to all the staff who keep the standards so high.,Universal Studios Singapore

JohanOfSweden,4.0,"April 2, 2019",Good for a day's visit,"Significantly smaller, but also only half the cost compared to its US cousins.

Less than 5 minutes wait for Transformers, Shrek etc.",Universal Studios Singapore
DaniFarrar,4.0,"April 2, 2019",Very good park,"This is a very good park, and a lot cheaper when compared to Orlando.  That being said it’s only 1 park and has way less coasters.

Good for children above 8 and teenagers. The price seems pretty high but it is worth at the end if you do all the activities. Take some rain coats or waterproof jackets because you may get wet while enjoying some games.,Universal Studios Singapore

Pedro Silva,5.0,"April 1, 2019","Very nice, perfect plan for one day out","The park is not huge, its more than enough for one day. If you want to enjoy and not be waiting for long (usually over 40min) per ride, just buy the fast track, it worth a lot when you're in a tight schedule and want to enjoy the best out of it. We went with our baby and even him enjoyed a lot, very curious and amazed with the figures walking around.",Universal Studios Singapore
kc j,4.0,"March 31, 2019",It's more for children,This was a new addition for us . We chose to visit early thinking that we will beat the crowd and the heat. We were surprised to find a huge queue. We braved it and finally entered. The brochure mentioned 24 attractions but all were not functional. Majority of the attractions are for children and a few for adults. It's a nice theme park but for children. It's only children who have the zeal to stand in the queue for one hour and have a ride for just 5 minutes. For us it was not very exciting. We liked the ambience and the idea. But the heat and the crowd was too stifling for our comfort. May be we should not have gone there in the first place.,Universal Studios Singapore
크리스틴,4.0,"March 31, 2019",Expected too much,"They say that a trip to Singapore is not complete without visiting the Universal Studies, but I beg to differ.  Though I did find the place interesting and memorable, having been to Hong Kong Disneyland, I prefer the latter more. I expected more, really.  With all honesty, I think the only difference among the rides there is the theme. I don't think those rides are that special since those were mostly rollercoasters, nothing more. I craved for a variety of rides that were full of originality and creativity.  Personally, I believe the scorching temperature and humid weather may have influenced my feedback. I don't think December was the perfect time to be there since I was overwhelmed with the crowd. I was not able to enjoy the rides and visit many attractions because of it. Plus, I found everything pricey, but I guess that's Singapore!  Just avoid the peak seasons and you'll enjoy the experience more than I did!",Universal Studios Singapore
grinnerperth,5.0,"March 31, 2019",Transformer Ride is Fantastic,"We were fortunate to have a family member drop us off at Sentosa island so it was a short walk up and out to the theme parks from the underground drop off point . This is where a taxi or Singapore’s version of Uber called Grab (an excellent service)will drop you off. When we arrived the queues to get in were massive luckily we had purchased tickets online so that was one less queue to be in . Very quickly we figured out that people will queue if there is a queue . The secret is to walk the path less trodden . At the main gates there are multiple entry points people just seem to gravitate to the centre walk to the sides and you can walk straight in. There is a fast pass available and we were there on a very busy day but the secret to not needing one is to not go to the first ride walk on to the third or fourth and you will be straight on the ride. Stay ahead of the crowds and you can ride all day no fast pass required. Every ride we went to had an indicated wait time of 5mins whilst some we walked past were and hour! Don’t miss the waterworkd show it’s awesome. Jurasic park ride you will get very wet and you can by a single use poncho if you don’t want to get wet they are about $5 each and very flimsy so I doubt you could wear it more than once. Save your money get wet cool down ,it’s always hot and feel good that you didn’t contribute another massive piece of plastic to the oceans of the world. Food is your normal theme park fare with some interesting Asian style twists $$$. Getting home we jumped on the monorail and back into the city on the MRT so easy just make sure you have an MRT card . We loaded ours with $10 and still had credit at the end of the week. The take home tips . Universal Studios is a must see. Save by not buying the fast pass just walk past the busy rides the next one won’t be. If you see a queue don’t join it walk to the front and see if there is an alternative (dont push in). Have a great day!",Universal Studios Singapore
Rebecca B,5.0,"March 31, 2019",Great Day out!!!,"Went on a Tuesday to avoid huge crowds and had a grand plan for the day. Our longest wait ended up being 40 minutes for the red side of Battlestar Galactica but most things we only waited 15-20 mins so wasn't worth buying an express pass. They did have to close Battlestar Galactica Cylon (Blue) for part of the day as it got stuck on launch (ick) but it was fixed.  Highly recommend going to see Waterworld and be warned if you sit in the Soak zone you will get soaked (think bucket loads of water) but its full of special effects, fire, jet skis, stunts.  We went on: Battlestar Galactica (both red and blue - blue is much better we went 3 times in a row!) The Mummy (love it! AIR CONDITIONED!!!!) Transformers: The Ride (cool 3D effects but quite jolty) Lights, Camera, Action (Actually better than I thought it would be, interesting to see behind film. Caution: wet ride) Canopy Flyer (Chilled out view with your legs dangling but actually quite fun backwards) Puss in boots giant journey (not designed for adults so much but good fun) Madagascar Crate Adventure (kinda sucks but why not...)  We ate at the food centre in the jurassic section, it was okay, we had vouchers for free food from the tickets that we bought so I wasn't that bothered about it being overpriced. Good value Souvenirs include getting a cup of soda from one of the stands as its like $5 but you get to take the good quality reusable plastic cup away with you. Much better value than anything actually in the souvenir shops.",Universal Studios Singapore
Robert S,5.0,"March 31, 2019",Amazing Family Fun Day Out,"As Sentosa residents we have annual passes which are great value for frequent visitors. The rides are amazing. Old favourites like Transformers, and the Battlestar Galactica pair of rollercoasters, are must tries, with plenty of less jarring rides for the whole family. Express Passes a must to skip the potentially 2 hour+ queues....",Universal Studios Singapore

sweeper21,5.0,"March 31, 2019",So much fun for all ages,"I'm an adult and really enjoyed Universal Studios Singapore! I've gone there so many times and enjoyed all of the rides. Depending on when you go and depending on how much time you have, I highly recommend buying the express pass. Sometimes the lines to get in to the park can be so long, even the line with the unlimited pass can be very long. That's why you have to buy the express pass. That line is usually very short. I've gone there several different times. Usually there are very few people and lines for the rides are very short on Friday evenings after 6 pm. Monday mornings are okay as long as you get there right when it opens.  The rides are all really good. My favorite one is the transformer.",Universal Studios Singapore

aprilgirlstrip,5.0,"March 30, 2019",Make sure you buy the express pass,So much fun but make sure you buy the express pass to skip the lines. We never waited more than 10mins for a ride.

Chickeatout,5.0,"March 29, 2019",Enjoyable day for me.... and the children,"We went there by taxi from beach road at 9 am, 1 hour before opening, weekday, not holiday time, equipped ourselves with ponchos and lots of waters. We took photos at the globe, checked again the height requirement posted outside of the gate, and walked around for 30 min, all shops still closed. At 9.45 the gate was already opened and we were like 10 in line, better get there sooner next time to be among the 1st (yes, I'm a freak). When it actually opened we (wife, husband, 2 children aged 2 and 4 in stroller), went straight to treasure hunter. We were number 1 there, the children loved it, then we went to mummy area, I forgot what we did here but I didn't remember went into anything because it was not suitable for my children's height. Then we passed the Jurassic park as well because it was opened at 11 and by that time it was still closed. Went straight to enchanted airways, no queque, went straight to the jet coaster, can't believe my 2 yo can be in this quite terrifying jet coaster and she loved it. My 4 yo has been on mild coaster in Disneyland Tokyo and Sea and in her opinion and mine this one is scarier. Went to Shrek 4D also no line (we prioritized these attractions knowing the lines will be long in the afternoon), the kids loved this. Puss in Boot only with my 4 yo, not as scary as the Enchanted airways. She liked this one. My 2 yo was waiting in the shop and can ride small ferris wheel inside (it said opened at 11 but it opened sooner at that time), Then we went to jurassic park at opening at 11 am, most people went straight to the right toward the boat attraction (I forgot the name, but this is the main attraction there) but we went to canopy flyer instead. Also not as scary as the coaster, thought both my children said it was scary. Only small line here, then went to Dino Soar next to it, the children loved this one. My 4 yo and me then went to queque in the boat thing, it said 15 min, but it was 1 hour long. We used our pochos here, glad we did because my child just got better from flu. My 4yo loved this one. She once waited 2 hour in disneyland when she was 3 for the critter attraction (with water splash too) so I know she can handle this one (in heat and patiently). While waiting my husband watched the velociraptor and stayed cool in the foodcourd. I followed them to the foodcourt, ordered the kids menu of dino shaped nuggets and smiley faced fries, the kids loved it. The parents ate chicken rice and it tasted okay really. Then we went to Madagaskar, ate Bingsu (really big) there. The children didn't want to watch Elmo or ride merry go round (strange right?), we went to the attraction on the right thay was like it's a small world though darker. We went to New York and did the spaghetti chase and live action by Steven Spielberg. The kids loved both but of course the impact of the live! action! was bigger for them. Then we went to Accelerator in Sci Fi just in time to watched Waterworld at 15.45 (the show only has 2 time slots and 16.15 was the last), people actually running for this. And I also followed suit with 1 kid each because we have to leave the stroller near the entrance gate. BUT DUE TO BAD WEATHER THE SHOW WAS CANCELLED AFTER 15 MIN. There was no raining only dark clouds but after watching the rest of the show in you tubes they have lots of fire so I imagined it is possible to get struck by lighting... at least in my mind t it could happen, anyway safety first. We headed home after that. Missed the 3D transformer because my children are tired. It was only 5 pm but it was really humid dan hot. Both then were sleeping, my husband and I walked to Vivo City after took picture with the merlion (they have elevator), it was a really nice walk. We ate at Kushi something there (I recommend not buying the kids menu there because it tasted awful but the adult menu was really good) and this mall also has a free playground for children.",Universal Studios Singapore

As my first time, everything seem waaw!! The spot for take photo, the game arena, live attractions, the souvenirs are cute. But there is no public-charging area, so its hard when we dont bring powerbank and our phones about to die. And the price for the meals is expensive.

Food and shopping for souvenirs are within too. There are games for all ages as well as for very young children too. Information and map are available at the entrance as well as ticketing office.  Those who are much older with heart ailments should not take rides that may cause serious health issues to yourself. Some of these rides like the roller coaster may not be suitable for those faint hearted. All rides within are to be taken at your own risks.  Most suitable for those who are daring to challenge their guts and enjoy those exciting rides.",Universal Studios Singapore

Ticket bought from Singapore airport counter which give us good offer than online or direct booking. It was combo ticket includes Universal studio and Garden by the bay. Due to weekday there was not much rush but still need to wait long to enter each ride. Better to buy Express pass to avoid long que and waste our time. (40 Singapore dollar for 1 time each ride and 70 for unlimited time). After 17:00 hrs there was not much rush and almost all rides were empty. Compared to other Universal studios in the world Singapore is the smallest one. Weather was hot and humid.

There were five realms the Fairy Land, Madagascar, the Egyptian World, the Futuristic world of Transformers and the Lost world of Jurassic Park. Each one was more captivating then the other. It has several rides some are high flying rides like Transformers rollercoaster and the Lost world where as the others are slower but equally interesting like 3D ride of Shrek but the best one amongst them was the Spielberg's stand where he takes us inside the making of his own movies (highly recommended). All in all if you are visiting Singapore for the first time do visit the Universal Studios.",Universal Studios Singapore

Tony A,4.0,"March 23, 2019",Good day out,"Set on an island, best way to get there is a grab taxi, about $20. We prebooked tickets with fastpass.

Collection tickets quick and easy and just like going to any universal or disney anywhere in the world. I dont know why i went on the 1st rides Battlestar Galactia as I dont have the stomach for roller coasters. Well i was green after them and that was me. We were obiviously there on a quiet day as we did not use a fasspass on one single ride. Someone was telling us that on a busy day you could wait for an hour per ride. Transformers 4D was excellent and also a couple of shows. We nipped out for lunch and went back in. Plenty of places to refill your water too. One comment i would make was the lack of characters throughout the park.

Is so so much smaller size than Florida.  It’s very clean even cleaner then the Japanese.

There is enough entertainment in the park to keep you busy all day long. My kids and I had a memorable good time and I strongly recommend coming here on your trip to Singapore and Sentosa Island.

Butchers_boi,5.0,"March 20, 2019",Great afternoon trip,"This is not a big theme park compared to others but the size makes it visitable in an afternoon. Easy to get to by various forms of transport or on foot the park is part of the wider Sentosa island which is worth an explore in its own right! As with any theme park be prepared to queue for the big rides. They are all worth the wait. We didn’t get in to the park until mid afternoon and it was busy, with some queue time being over 90 minutes. However as the afternoon turned into evening the waiting times got less. The day we visited there was a parade in the evening and once this had finished the park seemed to empty. This meant that the transformers ride had a 10 minute wait! I would definitely recommend this as a thing to do while in Singapore. Plan to go maybe first thing after opening and later in the afternoon to miss the crowds. Our ticket allowed us to leave and re-enter on the day purchased.",Universal Studios Singapore
Leeroy22,5.0,"March 20, 2019",VIP tour was worth the cost,"We paid $804 SGD for the three of us to do the VIP tour. If you want a special experience the I highly recommend it. No waiting around in the humid weather to go on rides, your tour guide takes you into special entrances and it is straight on. These entrances are not the express pass lines, they are even better. You receive a $15.00 meal voucher on the day too as well as a VIP lanyard that gives you express line privileges after the VIP finishes.You watch the Waterworld show in the comfort of an air conditioned room with great viewing seats. Our guide (Jet) was great. He was friendly and knew how to make us feel welcome. You also get 2 x photo opportunities with characters, our small group picked Transformers and the Madagascar characters. You only live once so make it special.",Universal Studios Singapore
Gints K,3.0,"March 20, 2019",Boring and most overrated attraction,"After reading so exciting reviews we had big hope on this attraction park, but reality was totally different - Universal Studios Singapore is extremely boring park for children and adults we struggled to fill the day as we wanted to see evening shows, but eventually we left park early as there was nothing more to do. The biggest problem was a rides which are very slow compared to big name attraction parks around the world - Battlestar Galactica was total disaster, very slow and boring and they have the most stupid regulations – you must leave all your money and bags in locker what is free of charge for one hour, but during day there was waiting time around one hour, so it is not clear how you can get your bag back if your do not have any money needed to open… Also finger scan was not reliable as system did not recognized original finger, but luckily for us opened the locker with different finger In other attractions there was pin codes that was more reliable, so my guess they were collecting visitors finger scans! The only ride that 9 year girl find interesting with some adrenaline in the whole park was Revenge of the Mummy, that we did 3 times – stated queue times were not very accurate – for some rides it stated that we must wait 10 minutes, but actual time was around 30 minutes, but for some other attraction there was no queue at all although at the entrance the waiting time was 30 minutes. The only ride we did not manage was Treasure Hunters which had waiting time over 1 hour, but as this was for toddlers we were not disappointed. As the rides were very dull then we spent most of the time in shows – WaterWorld we watched twice in this was top notch performance and I think is the best thing in this attraction park. Lights, Camera, Action!™ Hosted by Steven Spielberg show was short but again impressive with surprises – the biggest problem there was long waiting time. Do not miss Look out! Velociraptors have escaped in Jurassic Park! as they looked very realistic – again great performance. Eating was OK although not cheap, but kid gets some souvenirs at the same time so no need to go outside only to save 5-6 SGD. There is water refill point so bring some empty bottle (they did not checked bags at the entrance at all). And be advised that they have most stupid online booking system that is not simply working – even after transactions is approved by bank there is no tickets issued and luckily – also no money deducted so in the end you need still go to ticket box on buy tickets at the full price – might be mastercard server problem as Resorts World Sentosa are relying on mastercard – for me it looked that mastercard is using very old online system. So in the end we spend around 8 hours in park, shows were great, also park was clean and staff was superbly friendly and smiling but because of rides I would not recommend to visit universal studio – there are much more better things to do in Singapore or in Sentosa Resort. Maybe if this is your first attraction park or you have toddlers, then you can have different experience.",Universal Studios Singapore

SG-Travelling,4.0,"March 19, 2019",Not too bad,"This is the second amusement park i had been to. I am NOT an adrenaline seeking person so to me the rides are pretty good. Didnt managed to try the most exciting cyclone ride as the waiting time was extended to 70mins on a weekday. The shrek dragon ride gave me quite abit of adrenaline. The mummy ride seems familiar to 1 of the rides i took at Tokyo DisneySea. Went to the Elmo show where its catered to mainly kids. Language used is English. Elmo ride will be very good for toddlers too. The Madagascar ride had a ""scary"" ending. Haha the 2 tourists were scrambling for umbrella/ponchos when the cart we were in was approaching a mini waterfall, afraid of being drenched in water. You will understand what i mean after you have taken the ride. Food inside was quite expensive. I ate a burger with fries set costing S$15. There are water dispensers available amongst the park so if you want to save on beverage, just bring an empty water bottle and you will do fine. Overall i think you will be able to take all the rides within a day during weekdays. Just bear in mind of the scorching sun.",Universal Studios Singapore

I don't find it worth taking the cable car to there. The Sentosa express is just find. We did not get the express pass and it was just fine as it was week day. The queues were manageable. Some tips:  - Everyone rushes to the Transformers ride as soon as the park opens. We did too and waited for almost 1 hour. However at around noon waiting time was only 5 mins. So better wait to go during the day. - The Waterworld show is amazing. Do check the timing and plan your day such that you don't miss it. - There are raincoats on sale for SGD 5 at the shop next to the Jurassic park rapids adventure. Do get it you won't regret. We wish we saw if before our ride. Our clothes and shoes were all drenched. But don't miss this ride. It's really great. - The queue did not seem to end at the Cylon ride. But The Human roller coaster was around 5 mins waiting time during the last hour before the park closes. - The transformers roll out and Madagascar show is also really great,Universal Studios Singapore
affy_federer,5.0,"March 19, 2019",Universal stud day trip,I have been to a few universal studios. This was one of my favourites. Clean and queue jump availability. Large selection of food and restaurants. Amazing rides.,Universal Studios Singapore
Sneha,5.0,"March 19, 2019",Awesome - Totally Worth a Visit,"It’s the perfect place for the theme park lovers. We along with my 7 year old son just loved it. Most of the rides are family rides. To make a note of it, my 7 year old enjoyed all the rides thoroughly. He just was not allowed on Human and Cyclone rides. It’s indeed a park that we would love to go again and again.",Universal Studios Singapore
morpheus_GT,5.0,"March 19, 2019",Amazing themed park with a lot of attractions for all ages,"We went on a weekday to avoid long lines on some popular rides though you can buy Express Tickets to avoid the queues. I enjoyed the attractions like Revenge of the Mummy, Transformer Ultimate 3D Battle and Jurassic Park Rapids Adventure (prepare to get wet!!) The Lost World-Waterworld show is a must. Love the stunts and really fun to watch.  We took the train up to Harbourfront MRT Station and then a monorail Sentosa Express inside Vivo City Mall which drops you off to Universal Studios. It was easy to navigate inside the park.  Food and drinks are pricy but to be expected and there are plenty of options.  Can rent a small locker for the day so you don't have to worry about your bags when you go on the rides. Though some attractions do offer short term free lockers if you are not allowed to bring anything with you.  Recommend checking on the schedule of shows that you would like to see to help you plan your day inside the park.",Universal Studios Singapore
Beam wilasinee18,5.0,"March 19, 2019",Fun,World class theme park. Is a favorite of children. Many players. Suggest that you should buy express cards. In order to not have to queue for a long time It is expensive but better than wasting time on normal queues. Expensive food.,Universal Studios Singapore
John K,5.0,"March 18, 2019",Universal Studios,"Fantastic. This is the second time I have Ben there, this time with my wife. I’m a bit of a thrill seeker so this time I rode all the thrilling roller coasters, even ‘The Mummy’. There are a number of ways you can get to Sentosa Island. We chose MRT then cable car and mono rail which we thoroughly enjoyed. A great day for both couples and families.",Universal Studios Singapore
Wongster88,4.0,"March 18, 2019",VIP pass,"As I was travelling with both old and young, paid for VIP tickets. This was worth it as you literally walk right to the front of any ride, sit where you want and move onto the next. This meant my elderly mum did not have to stand in the heat (there’s only two seasons in Singapore: hot and super hot!). On rides she could not sit on, they had air-con family rooms for her to rest whilst she waited for us. Private guide took us around in 4 hrs, and we essentially covered all the park and rides in that time  Would I pay the same amount again with friends- absolutely not. The premium is too much. But if you have a mixture of young children and elderly folk to look after at the same time, it was worth paying for to keep everyone happy.",Universal Studios Singapore
Ben Ngo,5.0,"March 18, 2019",Amazing,My greatest fun: JUMP in front of the Universal Studio logo. I did it both in the US and Singapore. Did you too?,Universal Studios Singapore
Sammaz,5.0,"March 18, 2019",Worth a Visit,"We paid for the express entry which was quite expensive but definitely worth it for jumping the queue at the white rapids in Jurassic World and the Madagascar boat ride. Great for kids, I went with my wife and although we had a great day and I think our niece would’ve enjoyed it even more (and it would’ve cost a lot more money).",Universal Studios Singapore
Sonja G,5.0,"March 18, 2019",Great fun day,"Spent the day here,did lots and lots of walking .Was alot of fun. Quite reasonable price to go in.Long queue considering it was a Monday. Food and drinks not cheap but to be expected. Highly recommend to go there.",Universal Studios Singapore
Ahmad Al Madani,5.0,"March 18, 2019",Great place but expensive,Universal studio Singapore  The plays were good and must try  The staff were nice but not all of them  The price is little bit expensive  The place were very clean  If you would like to play and enjoy I would suggest to take the express line and pay 50 or 80 dollars on your preferences,Universal Studios Singapore
Ellie W,4.0,"March 17, 2019",Small but very entertaining,"We have never been to a universal studios, so can't compare to the others. But the park was well signed, nice even paths to get around and they took great effort to ensure a good deal of it was enclosed so you were shaded. (That Singapore sun, #sweaty)  The rides were pretty fun, our favourite was the rapids one in Jurassic Park. It's a must do. Closely followed by the Mummy ride in the Egypt section. We went on a Wednesday and the longest we waited was 30minutes, but that was for the rapids ride, it seemed super popular. The waterworld show was the best. The stunt people were very fun and looked like they were having fun as well!  The food was as you would expect from a theme park of any kind, expensive but decent enough. There was plenty of choice though.  Recommend hiring a locker it was only $16 for all day. It means when you go on rides you dont have to worry about your bags and the park isn't THAT big that is much of an effort to go back to it when you need it.",Universal Studios Singapore
Sarah L,5.0,"March 17, 2019","Great park, exceptional service.","We came with our two-year old for the Sesame Street Character breakfast.  It was really well done, with great staff who make sure every child has a great experience. We would highly recommend it.  Unfortunately our child became unwell during the breakfast, the service here didn’t falter and we were so well looked after by the entire team, we can’t thank them enough.",Universal Studios Singapore
Shelley M,5.0,"March 17, 2019",Loads of fun,"I had read previous posts and was worried it would be packed with lots of queues. We got tickets online and got fast passes too. Didn't need the fast pass at all, queues for rides not longer than 5 mins all day. Loved that we could leave park and come back, which we did and still didn't use our fast pass. But lovely park, well set out. Cylon ride is by far the best ride there, human was boring in comparison, jurassic park - wasn't so keen on boat spinning around as it just made me feel sick but ride was ok and you do get very, very wet. Transformers was good too and mummy ride was pretty cool. Canopy flyer was a bit hmmm . The rest are kiddy rides really. Park is well done with great themes and lots of expensive food options, but you can leave and come back which is great. Think we were lucky with crowds as it was very easy to get on what you wanted to ride. Great day out.",Universal Studios Singapore
FoodieFun,5.0,"March 16, 2019",Awesome place-imp points,"We visited on 25Dec, and did SEA and universal studio togather. 25Dec so it was super crowded. by the time we did 2nd ride it was already 2pm. We pondered on buying express pass (it was 110$ eash) and finally bought it. But still our group return time was 6.30. We decided to stay back and we had super fun. So imp getaways: 1. plan the visit on weekday when the studio is less crowded. 2. if you visit on holiday and you have already spent lot on travel, spend some more on express tickets, rather than waiting in line for hours. 3. Do checkout the parade etc, it's super fun for kids. Have fun!!",Universal Studios Singapore
SapphireGirl,5.0,"March 15, 2019",Don’t overdo it on the rides....or you may feel sick!,"I was amazed when I heard about the existence of Sentosa island and just had to go to universal studios!  This place didn’t disappoint. We unfortunately were delayed in our arrival here so only had about 5 and 1/2 hrs at the park (closes at 7pm mon-thur).  We tried to go on as many rides as possible which was tricky since a lot of them had long wait/queue times, some even up to 90 mins!  Managed to go on about 5 rides. They have a few smaller rides aimed at younger children which aren’t that wild or scary. I went on the puss in boots ride which was a rollercoaster and lots of fun. The Shrek 4D And transformers 4D were also very clever. I went on one of the large Sci-Fi City rollercoasters (Battlestar Galactica CYLON grey track) that goes upside down 5 times and has a corkscrew. Misleading wait time said 10 mins but was actually closer to 45 mins as the wait time indicator board outside wasn’t computerised and had to be updated manually and obviously hadn’t been updated for a while. This ride unfortunately made me feel so sick afterwards that I couldn’t enjoy the rest of the rides I went on afterwards.  Lots of gift shops, overpriced and also many of the deals require you to purchase multiple products from a range rather than single items.  Food choices aren’t great and also overpriced. We were fortunate to get a $5 food voucher when we purchased our tickets online beforehand so these made our $16 meal go down to $11.  The waterworld stunt show was impressive but a bit too violent for my liking. There are labelled seating areas in the auditorium which specify if you will get splashed on, drenched with water or stay dry as the show takes place in water.  A fun day out!",Universal Studios Singapore

David T,5.0,"March 12, 2019",Brilliant!!,"Fun filled day exploring the park. Much smaller then the Universal Studios in the USA but just as good. The smaller size means you can see everything in one day. We used the Sentosa Express to get to the island and would recommend it as it’s cheap, easy, and quick. Don’t forget a water bottle as Singapore is very hot and humid.",Universal Studios Singapore
haydend96,4.0,"March 12, 2019",Day trip,"We booked online which was really easy to do. Took the Sentosa express which drops you off within metres of universal studios. The park itself was really fun and easy to navigate. We went on a weekday and arrived right as gates open which is highly recommended. Lines for rides that aren’t as popular were short. But lines for some rides were 30+ minutes wait. If you don’t like waiting, would definitely recommend the express lane pass as I would get it if I was to return. Food was pricey but that’s typical for theme parks. Totally recommend the Waterworld show, it is amazing. One down fall was there was a storm warning in the afternoon and one of the meet and greets was cancelled but no one told us until we asked after waiting an extra 15 minutes.",Universal Studios Singapore

qianlinyan,5.0,"March 9, 2019",A Wonderful Trip in Singapore,"Last winter vacation, I went to Singapore with my family. Singapore is a place well worth visiting. We had a great trip to Singapore. The place that impressed me most in this tour was Universal Studios. Every event here was interesting, so there was a long queue for almost every event. My sister and I enjoy doing exciting things, so we lined up for the roller coaster. After about half an hour, we began to play the roller coaster. I felt very excited when the roller coaster was climbing. The car began to accelerate and I heard a deafening scream. I like the scenery when the roller coaster was high, I like the blue sky and the white clouds. If you do not want to play exciting games, there are many other projects here, and you can always find the right one. In the afternoon of that day, we watched a 4D movie in Universal Studios. 4D movies are a feature of Universal Studios. It is very cool! I felt like that I was in the film. The chairs in the cinema would move with the action and would occasionally blow. It was so interesting that many spectators shouted out. If you come to Singapore, highly suggest you come here. If you don not want to play in fun parks, you can walk along the beach in Singapore, the sand is very soft here. Of course, you can also swim in the sea. Again, Singapore is a place worth visiting, you can come here and spend your holiday.",Universal Studios Singapore

TeamSalas_Guam,5.0,"March 6, 2019",Fun for the whole family!!,"Our family loves theme parks, and we had the best time at Universal Singapore! Although quite smaller than other Universal theme parks, it actually worked best for our family (our Kids are 8, 5, and 2) because it wasn’t too overwhelming. We also found it to be not as crowded as most theme parks, but we also traveled during “green season”. The park was well-maintained with no closures, the shows we were able to watch were entertaining and fun! Food & snacks were pretty standard pricing for theme parks, but they’re always fun and the novelty is something our family loves 😜... “when in Rome”.",Universal Studios Singapore
Felicia,4.0,"March 6, 2019",Good Park,"Arriving early is key, but staying late may also reduce wait times. We opted to rent a small locker, prices were $12 for 4 hours or $16 for the day and located right inside entrance gates. You can open the locker throughout the day if needs be. At many attractions you can’t bring anything on with you and there are free lockers for short term use but we found it easier to put everything away and only get things out as needed. We were impressed at the effort to shade much of the park but I would still pack sun cream. As we visited on a week day the queues weren’t too bad but the popular attractions did crowd so we chose to wait until the end of day for the big roller coasters and were rewarded with a 10 minute wait. We are in the Madagascar food court and were disappointed but there are many other options in the park. Water is $4 so be prepared to purchase a few throughout the day. Also if you plan to go on the Jurassic park wet ride bring sandals so your runners don’t get wet and everyone on the attraction got wet. In the gift shops we also received a 10% discount for using Master Card, not sure if this was a temporary promo but he sure to ask. Great park with a lot of attractions for all ages. Highly recommend.",Universal Studios Singapore
Patricia L,4.0,"March 5, 2019",Very fun but lacking adrenaline,"Amazing sets, fun and realistic. We had a great and fun day but the only thing is that most of the rides are very short, they last less than 1 minute and sometimes is not worth comparing to the time you have to wait on the queues.

Thrilling rides, gripping shows in a fabulous setting. We didn't want to leave! However, we were very disappointed with the fastpass system whereby if you pay double the price for entry to the park you do not have to queue for the rides. Money talks, hey?!

The park was opened until 7pm. We did most of rides & activities diring day. My children went on some rides twice. There are shows during the whole day eg: shrek/ donkey. 4d cinema. Hurricane experience & waterworld show & much more. There are rapid water rides & high flyer. There are children & family rides & more thrilling daring roller costers. There is plenty to see & do.

Sakshi,5.0,"February 28, 2019",Adrenaline Rush !!,"For all those who are in search of adrenaline rush go to the Universal Studios !! Start your day with a picture under the globe and get in through the ticket transtiles. For discounts buy the Universal Studios Ticket from Klook or Changi Recommends. But if you buy through Changi Recommends do not forget to collect you tickets before leaving the Arrival Hall at the Airport.  After you get in the Universal Studios, put your phone and camera inside the bag and go for all the rides !! Not to miss : Transformers, Human, Cylone, Revenge of Mummy and Shrek 4D Adventure. Jurrasic Park Rapids Adventure is good but little over-rated !! Well all in all ... Universal Studio is a Must Visit if you are in Singapore for full day fun !!

The queues for rides were not to bad 40-50 mins for the most popular. Our favourite the transformers 3D ride, wow you are really transported into the movie. Also if you like fast and furious that will take your breath away try the cyclone. The restroom amenities were spotless for such a busy park. The only disappointment was the food in the American diner. Poor quality salad, with a few tough bits of chicken on top, the chicken burger was not much better. Apart from that great day out with loads to see and do, far far away land, Jurassic world, water world and much more. Great for kids and big kids like us. 79 Singapore dollars each, great value for a full day out.",Universal Studios Singapore
Rosbeeef,5.0,"February 27, 2019",Great fun even with young kids,"We was on the island and I really wanted to go to the studios, they are always fun and this place was great.  We was told that it was not good for young kids as the rides had height restrictions. Which is true but my 2 year old was not going on the rollercoaster rides anyway. Yes for sure a few with him being a little higher would have been good, but we all had a great time there.  They have most of it shaded and it was amazing to not have to walk in the heat like at some other parks where they just don’t cover the public areas (one in Hong Kong specifically). But this was really great as we could walk around the zones without diving into every shop to break from the sun... and Singapore can get very hot.  The rides where great and we went in the week, it was not busy and the wait times even for the major rides where short. We took turns going on the big rides and Cylon is a fantastic ride as well as he Transporters one.  Great day out !",Universal Studios Singapore
Robandwilson,4.0,"February 27, 2019",Small and compact,"After visiting Universal Studios Hollywood plus both Disney parks, my advice to everyone is forget about those parks and judge this one on what it is, it’s a great park with some really good rides, we turned up before opening 9:40 and were one of the first in, and managed to do half the park in first hour including the mummy and treasure hunters with no que, by midday we also had knocked off the Jurassic park ride and the mummy again all with out using our fast passes (we brought the one on each ride for $50 per person) waterworld show is entertaining, so it’s a must, then we smashed out the mummy again 4 times in a day, pretty hard core, and transformers 3 times, by 3pm we noticed the ques were massive so used our fast passes on battle star Human, master six looked scared but said he loved it, as far as food goes MELS dine in had a great offer, wish I had of tried the shrek waffles but there is always next time, only downer is the character interactions we seemed to just miss, and could not find the raptor... maybe next time.",Universal Studios Singapore

Water ride was good and the kids on the ride with us loved it (ride takes nine people) although we all got soaked but great fun. I would go back but would love to take our grandson. Enjoyed walking around the different areas. Nice day out.",Universal Studios Singapore
FinTraveller85,5.0,"February 25, 2019",Something for everyone!!,"Really a great place and the rides are super fun!! This is my second time in Universal Studios, 1st time was in LA.  There is a lot of different things to do for everyone. If you don’t like the rides you can always go around the area and watch those live performances/shows or go to Pantages theatre to see Sesame Street mini musical. Or you can go and watch Shrek 4D movie experience.  The rides are amazing! There is two big rollercoasters, Mummy ride, Transformers ride and lots of other rides for you to take. There is also two water rides which I didn’t took.  In Water World show make sure you know which areas are “soaked”, “might get wet” and so called safe zones.  After I took Mummy and Transformers ride I was so amused and caught my self thinking how did they do that with all the visual effects and 3D videos. You just have to experience it. They were amazing.  Even though Singapore is the most expensive city in Asia and the express pass at Universal Studios sets you back 129S$ (79S$ admission + 50S$ express pass) I’d say it’s worth it. I was in the Universal Studios on Monday before noon and there was already 40 minutes lines to some rides. Later afternoon the waiting times were 40-75 minutes so it’s nice to cut the line with express pass. I can imagine the amount of people there on weekends and holidays.  You can bring your own food and drinks to area. The food they sell there is not very good and drinks are quite highly priced but that’s how amusement parks work. I had an average burger combo for 16S$.  My recommendations: - Transformers ride - Lights! Camera! Action! by Steven Spielberg - Water World stunt show. - Mummy ride - Two big rollercoasters - Puss in Boots ride",Universal Studios Singapore
Simon A,2.0,"February 25, 2019",Needs to be improved,"We've been to most Universal parks, but this isn't the best. The organisation is poor. We got into the park bang on opening time, 10.00, rushed to the big roller coaster rides to be told they were not open yet. We rode another couple & went back to the rides to be told they were testing the rides. Didn't start taking passengers until 10.30ish. Later on at about 11.30, we went to another ride to be told via an announcement that the ride had temporarally closed to add more carriages. This should not have happened, these should have been tested & added to the rides before opening. Apart from that, the park is clean, smaller with fewer rides than others. Stand out rides - Shreck, Transformers & the water ride.",Universal Studios Singapore
Bish,5.0,"February 24, 2019",Great fun and exhilarating experience,"One of the best theme Parks I have been in . Amazing rides, especially the transformers ride. The mummy ride and battle star galactica rides are highly recommended for roller coaster enthusiasts. Fun shows all day to see and also to take pictures with the stars. Food options aplenty. Get an express pass if you are in a hurry to avoid the long cues, else plan for a nice fun long day.",Universal Studios Singapore
Michael T,5.0,"February 24, 2019",A Theme Park that will leave an unforgettable memory.,"If you're looking for excitement and fun, then the theme park is a must go. Enjoy all the exciting rides in the park itself or simy take photos with your favourite characters or actoresses like Marian Monroe. You can also enjoy some of the performances put up by the different groups of performers. And enjoy some of the delicious cuisine the park has to offer. A 5-stars entertainment park you just simply cannot resist or miss.",Universal Studios Singapore
Louise J,4.0,"February 24, 2019",Full daytrip,Lots of fun but alot of waiting in line. Expect to wait 1-2 hours at each ride. Would recommend going on a weekday. The transformeres ride is fantastic!,Universal Studios Singapore
Cherylle M,5.0,"February 24, 2019",Great fun!!,"Not a theme park fan but went for my 9 year old daughter with a friend and her teen daughter. I had the best day the rides were amazing definitely the Transformers ride was the best for me. The whole day was fun and the park is easy to navigate, the weather helps of course!. We bought the unlimited universal express tickets which were a blessing as you don’t queue very long. It was an expensive day but a one off so you expect that. Food rubbish but the rides and attractions made up for it definitely worth a visit",Universal Studios Singapore
Natalie,3.0,"February 24, 2019",MY ADVICE,"GO AFTER DARK. The only day this is possible really is Saturday as the park is open until 10pm!! This means short queues, no melting on the pavement, and no one blocking your shots. It also means most food stalls, places to eat, and on ride photo counters are also shut. But if you’re okay with this CANNOT recommend enough. I mean go during the day too to get the most of your ticket! But don’t bother waiting in an 80 minute line that you’ll be able to walk straight onto that night! :) Also. If you’ve been to Universal Studios in Hollywood- this park is much much smaller with not nearly as many attractions, which may be underwhelming. BUT it’s set out a million times better and makes for an easy walk through the different ‘worlds’",Universal Studios Singapore
Ms Filipina Traveler,2.0,"February 24, 2019",Just outside Universal,"I have been to Disneyland Aneheim so they said its smaller here, Maybe if i have a teenager or kids with me i will buy tickets :) Just wander around outside only. My friends was enjoying there tho....",Universal Studios Singapore

Most of the rides are roller coasters, but there is a lot to see and a lot of places to wander around. There are a lot of choices with food and it’s not too pricey. I did have trouble finding places to fill my water bottle and ended up buying a lot of water instead of being able to reuse one bottle.",Universal Studios Singapore
Isha S,5.0,"February 23, 2019",Must Go,"Place is amazing and is split into Hollywood, galactic, Egypt, far far away, Madagascar and Jurassic world.. place has varying opening hours so please reach by 9.. buy tickets online u will get discount as well... On weekends buy express ticket it's very expensive but worth it..or else you can try going for bigger rides in the end..we saw the same where towards end, waiting time for most of rides was 10 Min... Must must try for thrill lovers is cyclone, galaxy, transformer, ancient of Egypt. We also loved the amazing 5d show in far far away.. be sure to get ready to stand in queues.",Universal Studios Singapore
Arvi432,3.0,"February 23, 2019",Universal Studios,It would be advisable to visit universal studious early in order to avoid the heat and the long queues. A lot of rides have a single rider line which saves a lot of time. The park is not very big. There are some express passes available but these are expensive. It gets pretty humid in the afternoon so we watched a few shows during this time to beat the heat.,Universal Studios Singapore
Barry A,5.0,"February 23, 2019",Dont come to Singapore and not spend a day here.,Awesome experience. world class. if you book online dont take a screen shot of your ticket and expect it to scan. barcode may not read. i made that mistake. make sure you have a full size copy of the barcode on your phone saved. the guest services sorted it out very quickly. awesome experience. food is pricy. dont expect to eat for less than 15 or 20 singapore dollars. coca cola is 5 dollars. bring your own water.,Universal Studios Singapore

The place is big and you can easily spend 5-6 hours here.  Waiting for the rides can be frustrating as some of them are an hour or more queuing. But there is a lot going around to keep the whole family busy.  Best start early and start with the rides !!!  Food is limited in the area but the essentials are there........",Universal Studios Singapore
Vicky,5.0,"February 22, 2019",Amazing!!!!,"If you're visiting Singapore, do not miss this one! We spent a whole day here!! The 4D experience - moving coaster with 3D screens literally made us feel that we are in middle of the fight. The 2 high speed roller coasters were excellent!! Jurassic world - I really think you can avoid it. We waited about 70min in the queue to get in for just 5min of tube boat coaster which takes you through the jurassic jungle with robotic dinosaurs.

Franco Dionco,5.0,"February 21, 2019",A must,"We had so much here. We went on a Friday and it's packed. We rode the Galactica roller coaster and for its one of the best roller coaster ride ever. Don't miss the transformers, Waterworld show and the mummy ride. Our friends had a mini reunion and it worth every minute. Enjoyed the parade at night.",Universal Studios Singapore
ammar jawD,5.0,"February 21, 2019",Do not miss!,"Theme parks around the world are quite interesting. If you are an adrenaline junkie, you surely don't want to miss out on places like this!  Even if you're with your family, there are some rides which even they can enjoy and aren't fueled with scares. If you're visiting Singapore, do not even think about missing this one! You'll need a whole day here, so make sure you add this to your itinerary.  Special mention rides...  The Mummy: This one was one hell of a ride. First you need to take a long walk inside the structure and then there you reach to a dark cave like roller coaster which takes you to the Egyptian times taking you up down and all the sides in high speed in the dark. Gosh!!! Still can't get over it...went 2 times in this 😉  Transformers: The best 4D experience ever! The moving coaster with 3D screens literally made us feel that we are in middle of the fight. This one is even 10 times better than the one at Ferrari World Abu Dhabi. Greatest advantage of this ride is that even the elder people can enjoy this who are scared of roller coasters. It will be a supreme delight for them.  Jurassic world: (EXPECT A VERY LONG WAITING TIME) Yeah, you read the brackets right! We waited for almost 2 hrs in the queue. It's a tube boat coaster which takes you through the jurassic jungle with robotic dinosaurs. After experiencing it, I felt like it's here from where the inspiration for The Rajasaurus ride in Imagica has been taken from. If you've been to Rajasaurus in Imagica, it's pretty much the same but in open air and a few bumps in the river like in tube slides in a water park.  There were 2 high speed roller coasters as well (forgot their names). The red line coaster was fast but not awesome kinds. The grey line takes your breath away by swirling you around and taking you through the ground between the fog! Grey one was awesome!  In all, it was a fantastic day at Universal Studios Singapore!",Universal Studios Singapore
louisvvtttxx,4.0,"February 21, 2019",Small,Much smaller than Japan. We got the unlimated fast pass which was about $100 online from the sentosa website. I was planning to get from Klook originally but they were selling it for approx$230. Much cheaper to get it from the sentosa resort website,Universal Studios Singapore
rach91177,5.0,"February 20, 2019",2nd visit,This was our second visit and we enjoyed it as much as the first. We saw things we missed the first time (2018).

You can get a pass out to access resorts world restaurants as well which we found handy,Universal Studios Singapore

Tracey M,4.0,"February 19, 2019",Must do whilst in Sentosa,Managed to get on all the rides quickly. I would definitely recommend an express pass as by lunch time many rides had a wait time of 40 - 60 mins. 2 rides had technical issues so we could not rode and one ride had an issue with the lift so again could not ride as my husband is disabled. Food and drink over priced but that is to be expected You can get a stamp out and visit the Malaysian food court next door for cheap eats.,Universal Studios Singapore

JD R,4.0,"February 19, 2019",A good half day for casual coaster fans,"If you love rides and have been to the more famous parks around the world; then this is middling to meh. I wouldn't have enjoyed myself as much if I didn't have Q-jump.  If you are OK with rides, or untested, this has a wide enough selection to help you decide whether you are an adrenaline seeker or not. Cy-Lon is the most hardcore it gets in this park so plan accordingly.  I rode everything worth riding:  Sesame Street coaster - is good for kids; but over really too quickly ,;D Transformers Ride - surprised the kids weren't freaked out, really good '4D' ride Puss n' Boots coaster - kid friendly but throws the stomach around more than you'd think The Mummy Ride - it's fast-ish coaster ride in the dark, and not much of the horror house 'BOO' as I would have wanted. Jurassic Park - good, over very quickly and you may well get wet. Bring a parka Battlestar Galactica: HUMAN - might be at your limit if you're not into 'coasters Battlestar Galactica: CY-LON - might be at your limit or just beyond. Because of the loops and screws, it's more disorienting than HUMAN, for some that means 'NO WAY' but I thought the G's were more noticeable on HUMAN. That said I've definitely ridden more ominous rides  Food and drink options are relatively good and not crazy expensive like comparable parks. As you'd expect from Sg as a whole I think.  Anything missing? Yes, I'd say a vertical drop ride. (Which I am not sure I would have gone in for anyway...)",Universal Studios Singapore
Heidi M,5.0,"February 19, 2019",Great day out,"My partner and I visited today and he isn’t keen on massive rollercoasters so was a bit skeptical about visiting however, there was plenty to do without just the rides.

Indra Wantah,5.0,"February 19, 2019",firts timer,"well this my first time in USS, easy access, either you can walk around 20 minutes or take the monorail sgd $4 (you can pay this with your ez link card/mrt card), arrive at harbourfront station, go to the level 3 for the monorail or level 1 if you want to walk.. once you reached the first station Waterfront, disembark and walk for around 5-10 minutes, and you'll see the famous universal studio ball.. it was on sunday, and i think we got lucky bcoz it's not too packed with people.. you can bring your own water and foods, or you can buy them there, expensive? of course.. okay, once you enter, take a uss map. you have to make a list of games that you want to try first, for me, it's transformer, mummy returns, battlestar galactica (both of them), waterworld show.. ana after that you play anything across your path.. i have the priveledge to play the transformers twice and battlestar roller coaster 3 times.. and i don't even bought any express cards.. got a cheap tickets from Traveloka apps, almost the same price with Klooks, but cheaper.. just show your e-tickets at the entrance and thats it.. hope this helps, oww opening hour is 10 AM singapore time.",Universal Studios Singapore

Sarah,4.0,"February 13, 2019",Express Pass needed,"We paid extra for an express pass and I’m glad we did as many of the popular attractions had queue times well over an hour. The whole park is clean and well maintained. All of our interactions with staff were good. Some rides offer free lockers for 45mins and others you have to pay for. I’m not a rollercoaster fan, King Julien of Madagascar’s carousel is up my street, that said I foolishly ignored the warnings for the Mummy ride and have since vowed never to go on such a ride again! The Transformers 4D simulations is one of the best of it’s kind in my opinion and we went on it twice! I highly recommend paying $5 for the drying booth after the Jurassic Park ride although be warned it only dries you to a certain extent and I was convinced I looked like I had had a mishap! With the use of the express pass we (two adults) got around the park in under five hours.",Universal Studios Singapore
Foxlo85,5.0,"February 13, 2019",Great rides and easily reachable by MRT,"For around £40 this park is great value. There's perhaps not as many rollercoasters as other theme parks of this calibre but the size of the park makes it easily do-able in 4-6 hours even if there are long queues for some rides.  The Transformers ride is fantastic, as is the Battlestar Gallactica ride - the Cylon side is much more intense than the Human side, we loved it. The Jurassic Park rapids are also great fun and an honorable mention for The Mummy!",Universal Studios Singapore

VikashSaraf,5.0,"February 13, 2019",Gr8 experience.,"A must place to visit in Singapore. You should divide you group as per age-group in smaller ones to cover it completely else, even one day would be short. There is lot to watch, enjoy and experience. Every section is worth and you can have your each penny count. Collect map at the entrance and plan your day sectionwise. Don't go on weekends if you have a choice, and do buy a Express pass if you can afford. Waiting time in each adventure ride is 60 minutes plus on average. On express you can simply walk in. Start early in the day ( at 9 am) because the Studios closes at 6 p.m. A must for all age groups.",Universal Studios Singapore
Katheryn F,5.0,"February 13, 2019",Great fun in Singapore!,"eight years ago when we lived in Japan, we came to Universal Studios twice on vacation. For the past year and a half, since moving to Singapore, my family has held season passes to Universal Studios.  The park does a really nice job of keeping things current and having special holiday programming. “Halloween horror nights” for example, is very well done. They turn some of the non-ride areas into themed haunted houses. * please note that there is an extra charge for Halloween horror nights even for passholders. In general this is for teens or adults and can be VERY frightening for younger children.  We have gone Universal enough times to make the passes worthwhile! We really enjoy all of the rides as they are generally good for a range of children ages 8 to 18 (of course there are also a few rides for smaller children).  When buying a season pass, definitely consider the Express Pass. This will allow you to bypass the general admission line and get on the rides quicker. For certain rides, they have a “single rider,” which means if your party wants to stand together in line, but doesn’t care if you go on the same ride at the same time, you can also bypass longer lines. * Not every ride has “express” or “single rider” options.  The park is always very clean and the rides seem to be operated safely. The food is usually decent but overpriced since it is a theme park. Do note that some vendors don’t take credit cards and only deal in Singapore cash. Specifically, the iced-slushy vendor - which is a favorite.  The Indian food set across from the mummy ride is very good, my kids love the Dino nuggets near Jurassic Park, and my kids like the green Shrek waffles.  The Transformers ride is a three-dimensional experience so be wary if you get motion sick. I always take 1/2 of a Dramamine before going to this park so that I can enjoy all of the adventure rides happily!  Also note, you will get WET on the Jurassic park River Adventure! Your stuff will get WET on the Jurassic Park River Adventure. Your raft will flood. So, bring a plastic garbage bag, or rain poncho if you don’t want you and your things to get wet, and don’t put anything on the floor of the raft.  Enjoy Universal!",Universal Studios Singapore

Betty345123,4.0,"February 11, 2019",Vacation,"We went to Universal one of our vacation days in Singapore. It was very easy to get to and took the monorail in. When going to the monorail, they didn't have each line sectioned off, so when the train came everyone just pushed each other to get on the train. This was not a good policy and you wouldn't have that in the US Florida Universal. The park was very busy but still nice. Again in the park for the rides that you went in and it had large open doorways no set lines and people just pushing to get in. At one point I lost my husband for a few minutes cause people were pushing both in different directions, they should have a better handle on this. People can get hurt by them not dealing with crowds.

Roberto L,1.0,"February 9, 2019",Not worth it!,- its hot and humid! A lot! - food has poor quality. - express pass it cost a fortune and some of the attractions doesn’t accept it! So you’re talking about 40 to 50 min to ride 5 min!!! Seriously? - place is fully packed!,Universal Studios Singapore
Andrew E,3.0,"February 9, 2019","If you don't pay the large amount extra for an express pass, it makes the queuing very long.","We enjoyed the atmosphere of Universal and managed to get on a few rides in the morning without queuing for too long. However once the masses arrived, we couldn't get on some rides we wanted as the queuing time was more than 70 to 90 minutes for each. So in the afternoon we went on the less popular rides, but still needed to queue for around 30 to 40 minutes. If you don't paying more than double for your ticket then you can get the express pass ticket and queue for longer, but we didn't feel this was right and everyone should have had a chance to get a faster ticket for 1 or 2 rides even with the ordinary ticket!",Universal Studios Singapore
Fae Ong,5.0,"February 8, 2019",A must for theme park lovers,"even though I am a huge fan of Disney and Disney parks, universal studios singapore was a really great experience for me. We went on a sunday and since it was a weekend, there are lots of crowds and tourists, but we still managed to ride most of the attractions and even watched some shows. We didn't get to ride the human vs cyclone ride since i'm not really into extreme rides. I also got to meet characters from one of my fave shows Puss and the Boots, we bought lots of souvenirs for ourselves and family and friends back home too. It was definitely a fun and memorable day",Universal Studios Singapore
Omar,4.0,"February 8, 2019",Fun rainy day,Fun day even with rain Get the express pass ( necessity) Wear trainers Take an umbrella( yes you can store it before any attraction) Avoid eating in the park.... over priced and too much to wait ( 1 h for 2 standard burgers) And have fun,Universal Studios Singapore
CassHongKong_China,3.0,"February 8, 2019",Limited attractions for thrill seekers,"We visited with our twin teens and found that only 4 of the rides were thrilling enough for us - Transformers 4D, and the rollercoasters - The Mummy, Battlestar Galatica Cylon & Human. The rest cater to younger children and/or are just pleasant rides (not worth spending 30+ minutes or more in the queues). Food and drinks were expensive e.g. a simple hotdog cost S$18!",Universal Studios Singapore
Tam T,5.0,"February 8, 2019",Jia Yee from Hotdog stall in USS - a Star Staff,"Was having a hotdog in the lost world's hotdog kiosk, and was struck by the diligence of this guy clearing the tables, and ushering the customers (who does that in a hot dog kiosk amazing). Then we realised someone left their laptop bag behind, and so I called him over to help deal with it. He swiftly took it away, and returned to us amidst his busyness to give us an update that it was safely deposited with the front counter and they would deal with it. His spirit of tirelessness in a job that people don't usually take seriously really impressed me. Hope it doesn't die out!",Universal Studios Singapore
Usha65,4.0,"February 8, 2019",Will be liked by only a few,This is a good place for those who has not seen the Universal studios in Los angels. This is a smaller version. Many attractions are good but it is over crowded. One has to wait in long queues to see many attractions. The restaurants are also crowded and was difficult to enter.,Universal Studios Singapore
Hungrylions03,2.0,"February 7, 2019",Over rated place.,This is quite over rated so i went there with a lot of expectations but the rides were not that great and scary. We were in group who had visited Adlabs imagica In Mumbai and Rides of Universal studio was no scary compared to Here in Imagica. Only thing i like is effects of few ride. Place was over crowded.,Universal Studios Singapore
Snowmanuncle,3.0,"February 7, 2019","Don't come during weekends, public holiday and hot days !!","We go at the Chinese New Year and it was scarily crowded which we expected. However, i think the studio can do better on the temperature control since Singapore is a place which almost very hot all the year! I got sweat and my whole T-shirt was wet while I just waiting for my first queue! We see many big coil fans but they seems a decoration more then used as a fan! Every queue was more then 60 minutes and i am glad I still survive after one day playing in the studio with my kid. My suggestion is: Don't come during weekends, public holiday and remember to bring with you your portable USB fan !!",Universal Studios Singapore
moonlight_20,5.0,"February 6, 2019",Great day out!,"The layout of universal studios is amazing, you can start from one side and loop right over to the other side without missing a single thing! The rides are all amazing but I recommend going on a weekday as we only had to wait a maximum of 15 minutes on the larger rides and other rides we could go on and get back on again. There is a large variety of food but is quite overpriced as you can expect. Getting to Sentosa island is a must to get in early and have a full day. I definitely recommend everyone to visit universal studios if your in Singapore as it is a place that you can not miss!",Universal Studios Singapore
Scott W,4.0,"February 6, 2019",Great place for the kids,"Enjoyed our time at Universal Studios, fantastic clean and well laid out park.

pamatu049,5.0,"February 5, 2019",Great experience!,"Spent with my family (6 yo. + 18 months) from 11am until 6pm (started to rain). Until ca 2pm waiting time ca 120 minutes, express pass ca 20 - 40 min. It is definitely worth to by an express pass unlimited (199 for adult and 179 for a child). Infant for free.  Note, that after that all you have a big problem to find a transportation to your hotel. Waiting time for a taxi is 1 - 2 hours, take a limo (ca 10 min and 50 SGD).  Food: not expensive and good. Recommend restaurant in Madagaskar (not so many people...)  It is a one day attraction.",Universal Studios Singapore

HolliexMay,1.0,"February 5, 2019",DO NOT BOTHER,Cannot believe how awful our experience was today. We arrived at 10am to crowds of people. By 12.45 we still hadn't even been able to get on 1 ride! The ride we had queued for 90mins for (when the sign and announcement said 45min wait) we got to the front and then was told the ride had a fault! After further waiting the announcement stated they had no time scale of when the ride would be repaired and advise people to leave the queue and a member of staff would direct you out. No member of staff wanted to help anyone! Totally different experience to Florida where the staff go above and beyond and even gave us fast passes to enjoy another ride and skip the queue to apologise for waiting so long and not getting to ride. We left the park at 1pm after spending $158 on entry and having not been on any rides. Absolutely furious about a loss of that amount of money and a waste of a day on a short holiday,Universal Studios Singapore
Tanya H,1.0,"February 4, 2019",Don’t waste your money this weekend,"We visited Universal Studios today and i would have no hesitation in stating Don’t Do It!!!! After spending over $500 today at Universal on entry tickets and food for 2rides and one show it is certainly not worth the money. Stating that rides would be 40 mins that turned into almost 2 hour waits with people jumping queue. It was terrible. Just to many people with express tickets and no caps. Everything shut down around 5pm due to the storm which we certainly understand. Very disappointed, will never recommend this place. Certainly nothing on LA Universal Studios.",Universal Studios Singapore
Rukmani I,5.0,"February 4, 2019",not for the week minds,"Everyone knows which ride and which show but more than rides the worst at Universal is the waiting line. Enter early and finish the 3-4 main rides (human / Battlestar / transformer / mummy or pyramid one) to avoid queues, post an hour or so...it will be approx 1 hour waiting. The trick which most people tried was, everyone went in single's line. Thus avoiding waiting in queue but you need to be prepared to ride alone. As written by many - take a map once you enter, mark the shows you want to see, finish the major 3-4 rides and then start exploring the place",Universal Studios Singapore
NicDacre,3.0,"February 3, 2019",More for kids,"If your looking for roller coasters and thrill rides, you should probably pass on spending $60+ for a day pass. I wanted to go to universal Singapore just for the heck of it because I have been to both in the United States and thought “why not?”. But to be fair, I got through this park in an afternoon. The transformers and mummy ride were the best, the duelling roller coaster was alright. If your bored in Singapore and looking for an afternoon of something to do it’s kind of fun to see, just don’t expect to be blown away by thrill rides as it’s a pretty small park.",Universal Studios Singapore
Kari Sch,4.0,"February 3, 2019",You may not get what you were after,"This park is beautiful, and quite complete, but we felt it was a bit expensive for what we got back. We went in January, when there are only two long days a week (closing at 10 pm), only one of which there was a parade AND fireworks planned. However, due to a potential weather issue (note that it did not even rained a drop), they cancelled both. After googling, it appears this happens frequently and it does not surprise me as it rains in Singapore more often than not. I mean, I get it, it makes sense. But I post this for others to think about this when choosing when to go and why. We had the longest queues on that day and a long wait until 10:15 pm on the heat with the kids only to be dissapointed after announcements of delays and then cancellations of the special events the whole day. Anyways, if you are a fan of theme parks like us, you'd do the park twice. Then on the bright side, you can upgrade your ticket to a seasonal pass for only 30 SGD and go again and again if your stay allows. Just go to the membership office next to the entrance during your visit and in ten minutes you walk out with your card, even if you are a tourist! Not that the queues are much shorter on short days, though.",Universal Studios Singapore
jacqueline,4.0,"February 2, 2019",Go on a Friday night after dark!,"This place was good but very busy during the day especially with many tourists visiting for Chinese New Year. It’s smaller than the LA one but rides are generally the same. My cousin and I also got grabbed a pass out & came back after dark on the Friday night as they’re open till 10pm. It was soooo much better! Much cooler, no lines for the lockers or rides & the view from the roller coasters are really nice! The burgers at Mel’s drive in are really nice (and honestly probably a bit nicer than at Hard Rock Cafe). Also love that you get reusable drink cups and can refill!",Universal Studios Singapore

Gluteusmaxi,2.0,"January 31, 2019",Disappointing,"To say I was disappointed would be understating it.  1) Overpriced Entry Fee 2) Overpriced Food 3) 45min - 60min waits to ride attractions  I would suggest you spend your time and money doing something else. Unless you’re the type of person you likes standing around in lines. If you enjoy traffic jams on highways then this place is right up your alley.  To make it worse, it’s in Singapore, which means you’re not only standing around in lines but you’re doing it with a heap of pushy asians. I got here at 11:00am and at 14:00 I had ridden two rides.  $13.00 for chicken rice and it pales in comparison to the one we had at Maxell Hawker Centre for $3.50.  $4.00 for a drink of water.

Gemma R,1.0,"January 29, 2019",Universal Rip Off,1.5 hour wait for 5 minute ride (if it states 60min wait then this means 1.5hrs +). $50 for 1 pizza and $5 for a small can of soft drink. Wifi did not work. Too many shops trying to sell you over priced crap and not enough rides. If you lose a child there is no announcement or golf buggy to assist you...who cares as once you have paid to get in that is all that matters. My two boys hated it.

Christine,3.0,"January 24, 2019",USS was a little disappointing,"I'm a Singaporean and this is my 4th time here over the past 6 to 7 years? Of all the trips, I would have to say that Today was the most disappointing trip of all. Madagascar 4D Experience was good itself but the park should think about getting guides who can speak proper English. The girl was not able to enunciate her words properly and even me as a Singaporean found it hard to understand her. What about foreigners? Jurassic rapid ride- what happened to the t rex stimulation at the end before we dropped? Was kind of boring without that part. The water show was under renovation. The transformers ride had a glitch in the middle where there was no lights or sounds . We were left in the dark for like 10 seconds. I went again during the evening and it worked fine then. People were not the friendliest around the park. If you can't deal with crowds then please don't work there. You should think about having controlled entry into the park. Have a limit of visitors. The maximum q was like 1.5 hours today but why would anyone want to spend that amount on a busy day with so little rides. Really quite a turn off.",Universal Studios Singapore

Most of the attractions are not scary at all and are extremely short but they are a lot of fun. We bought the tickets on Klook and all we had to do was to scan at the entrance. It was very quick and convenient. There aren’t many food options but there are many right outside the park so i’d Suggest eating before going.

It was also sad as 2 rides were not available (Rapid Adventures, and one where you can do the driving/tour ""not so sure""). Anyhow, a must see!",Universal Studios Singapore
Travellin_w_kids,4.0,"January 23, 2019",Get the xpress pass,"We went on a Saturday and it was rather busy, but we still managed to go on about 12 rides and see a few shows so it ended up being worth it. Lines were about 30-45mins long but we didn’t go on the big attractions like the Battlestar Galactica or Transformers which had lines over an hour long. However I really recommend getting the Xpress pass so you get more out of your day and don’t have to deal with whining kids.  My main gripe from the day was the Sesame Street show, which my 3 year old was really getting into. Then for some reason, halfway through, it stopped suddenly and we were told to leave the building with no reason given other than a “technical difficulty.” I really think that for supposedly being an “award winning stage show” the actors should have been professional enough to keep going and improvise, instead of disappointing hundreds of little kids with no proper explanation given.  For food- there are lots of over priced Chinese or deep fried options around. I’d recommend stepping out of there and exploring all the other options close by.  In terms of kids- Toilets are always close by and all seemed to have a baby change facility. Prams are handy to have as there is a lot of walking to do for little feet, otherwise you can also hire one. There are drink fountains everywhere so it might be advantageous to bring some water bottles in and fill them up while you’re there to save $ (drinks are expensive in there!). Im thankful we brought in little fans with a mist spray as it got hot in the lines and the kids would have something else to complain about.  We ended up spending about 8 hours there and could have easily spent longer if the kids weren’t so tired. It was an expensive day out but in the end I think we got our money’s worth. A must do in Sentosa.",Universal Studios Singapore
LasCasitas,3.0,"January 23, 2019",Not as slick as Florida,"An okay day out but not really value for money. The Mummy, Transformers and The Humans are good rides but 2 of tge 3 were out of order until lunchtime. The Rapids in Jurassic were out of order all day and Waterworld was closed for maintenance. Food and drink overpriced as you would expect.",Universal Studios Singapore
Shah M,4.0,"January 23, 2019",Adventure park,Good theme park to spend a day. Rides are good enough. If you go on a holiday you may face big queue for each fantastic ride. The Roller coaster is very scary. The transformers ride- i liked the most.,Universal Studios Singapore
William Mc Adam,3.0,"January 23, 2019",Not Los Angeles or Florida,"Not up to its American siblings I’m afraid! Lovely space but could be more dynamic. The practice of charging for lockers for loose items prior to going on rides I thought was a bit much. Looks OK with a free 60 minutes but after waiting over an hour in a queue to get to the ride (in a quiet period) then charged 4 dollars to retrieve the bag, but then to add insult to injury by swallowing my ten dollar bill with no change given! Ridiculous!",Universal Studios Singapore

TRAVEL TIP - Make sure to pay the extra and get the express queue jump tickets, TRUST ME its well worth it. Some rides were up to 2 hours long ! if you only have 1 day you will only see 3 rides if that. The Mummy was my best ride and the kids loved waterworld and Puss in Boots, also Transformers and Battle Star Galactica we very fast and fun. The food was a bit boring and just basic Asian fried stuff but we did find hot dogs near the Waterworld show.  Worth a day if you have the time.

In the past two months, I have had a few terrible experiences at the Sesame Street show. They kept canceling the shows in the middle of their performances, left the audiences, especially kids disappointed. Moreover, they have even changed the schedule of the shows without notice. When being asked about the changes, their stuff member became impatience and rude. They said “if you have gotten a problem with it, go to the customer service”. He didn’t have the time to give a simple explanation. Very disappointed and will not come back anymore!",Universal Studios Singapore
Megan T,5.0,"January 19, 2019",Fun day!,"We really had a great time here! We went to USS during weekdays but still at Treasure Hunt we had to wait in line for 40mins, when we got on the ride, it was totally worthless! The ride only lasted 5-7minutes, quite boring.  We were lucky to get some pictures taken with Bumblebee and Optimus Prime even though it was quite a long line but didn’t take long.  We went on the Transformer ride & Revenge of the mummy, what a ride!! Scary and fun at the same time! Adrenaline pumped!  Overall it was quite worthed to spend the whole day in USS.",Universal Studios Singapore
joemilli,5.0,"January 19, 2019",An ultimate universal experience.,This was our second time at this theme park. Our sons are older this time around but we still loved the experience.

Trina Moore,4.0,"January 19, 2019",Great Place but avoid the crowds,"Love Singapore Universal Studios it is a fantastic set up with lots of great rides. We went between Christmas and New year and would never do again, the lines to get on a ride were up to 2hrs wait time in the heat, It just wasn’t feasible, I think that they over sell tickets and then no one enjoys the day.  We went back and lined up for about half an hr to try and buy an express pass which was for one ride only on each it had gone up from the usual 30 per person to 120 Singapore dollars per person on top of the 80 gate price, I asked what the wait times would be and were told maybe half so they were also overselling the express passes so we didn’t do it.  Ended up waiting 50 minutes for Madagascar ride, Jurassic Park 40 minutes and the special effects which was only 30 minutes and were unable to get on any other due to lines, so felt disappointed we couldn’t do any of the Adrenalin rides which is why we went and wished that this had been explained at the ticket counter that expected wait times were excessive.  If going plan your day not around Christmas or weekends",Universal Studios Singapore
Rohit,5.0,"January 19, 2019",Awesome visit,Excellent place to visit specially with kids. Lot of rides for all age group. You have option to refill your water bottles every 200 meters. There is express entry ticket which will help to bypass crowd.,Universal Studios Singapore

AgnitaPandian,5.0,"January 18, 2019",So many good rides!!,The park was simply amazing. So many great rides for a 6 year old. Don’t miss Canopy Flyer - it’s a fun ride: lines are longest though.  Would totally go again.,Universal Studios Singapore

We visited on a Monday, the park was not packed and even though line ups were much shorter than usually we did wait for one ride an hour and 10 min. I do recommend the fast pass even though it is pricey- 60 $ on top of the 78 $ admission ticket.",Universal Studios Singapore
Lynne R,4.0,"January 18, 2019",New Years Eve 2018,Decided to go to Universal for New Years Eve. Definitely worth getting the Express pass as I did not have to wait for any rides even though some rides had 1 hour cues. Also if you are a solo rider quite often you get put to the front of the cue to make up the numbers. You get free Wifi. Even though it had rained that afternoon all the rides were open. Still decorated with Christmas lights and decorations. Had dinner at Mel’s diner that was pretty ordinary. The usual American fare of basic cheeseburgers and fries. The Waterworld show is great to watch but take a poncho if you set in the ‘get wet’ seats. There were New Years Eve fireworks which were great except the sound was totally distorted which was disappointing. Very enjoyable night.,Universal Studios Singapore

U can reach here from vivo mall by buying the ticket for using train cost $4 SGD. U can buy on the spot. But it said u can buy it online. Be prepare for the raincoat if i want to ride attractions that have water effect on it. U can also buy here for $5 SGD.  Tips: Prepare snack or lunch because it's so exspensive here.,Universal Studios Singapore

No bars no Harry Potter . But then it’s cheaper so we had 3x ride on transformers , we had great fun , I would recommended just don’t think it’s big . Lovely place. We had the first normal ticket but then we saw some attraction with long 40min and more queue so we easy upgrades our tickets and we r glad we done it. :)",Universal Studios Singapore
Rebecca H,3.0,"January 18, 2019",Too long and too hot.,My husband and visited in early January and expected that it would be busy but were not prepared for the lines and heat that we experienced. Every ride had at least 1 hour 15 minutes wait and there was minimal shaded areas. We ended up paying to enter The park completed a lap of the park and then left. We were under the impression that it was film sets and behind the scenes looks rather than rides and theme park style games ( that’s on us for not researching more I guess).  It was a great atmosphere we were just disappointed by the waiting times. I think families with young ones would love it just get up early to miss the masses.  Overall great looking and interesting attractions we just didn’t go at the best time.,Universal Studios Singapore
DaniM,4.0,"January 17, 2019","Great park, very busy","Universal Studios Singapore was fantastic. It's clean, and has lots to do. My recommendation would be to try and choose a time to go that isn't super busy time. We made the mistake of going in between Christmas and New Years when everyone was on holidays. Some of the rides had up to a 120 minute wait, and getting a seat in the eating areas proved almost impossible. The park does offer pass outs, so we were able to eat lunch outside of the park and go back in once we were ready.  Over all, its a fun day out and definitely worth going!",Universal Studios Singapore
Mitch K,5.0,"January 17, 2019",Great family day out,"My family had a great time here over Christmas. We were able to get on all the rides in one day. I have an 8 year old and a 4 year old.

This is a great family day out and is probably the best memory of Singapore for my family.",Universal Studios Singapore
Tammy M,4.0,"January 17, 2019",Great,"First time at an adventure park of this nature with kids aged 10 and 12. Bought the tickets via klook.com. bought the express tkts too after all the reviews. We lined up in the priority line at 9.30 and felt pretty special considering the lines for normal were getting bigger. They gave us a show time pamphlet in line so had time to sort out the plan of attack. Rides first based on other reviews. Here they are  Transformers # 5 Revenge of mummy Battlestar galactica human.. cyclon is worse. Me.. human only #1 🤢 Jurassic park water ride #6 Shrek 4d # 3 Waterworld ... first show at 1pm Lights camera action # 4 Madagascar Puss in boots Canopy flyer #2  I didnt go on revenge of mummy bc after human i felt a little queasy all day. Loved transformers and should have gone on jurassic park earlier. Yes u will get wet... but id ur wearing quik dry ull be okay... anyway having the express pass helped us at this ride and a few others . by the time we got at jurassic park the wait for normal was 80 mins. We waited 20 mins max. So i suggest rides then shows, meet and greets if u like then shops. Its not a big place but leave shopping till last. We had lunch at 11.30 at mels diner. Cost about $ 80 for small portions of food for four but no one in there and no waiting time. Started to get busy about 12.15. Great atmosphere tho. The place is clean. We went on a weekday and we weren't bumping shoulders with everyone. Enjoy",Universal Studios Singapore
V L,4.0,"January 17, 2019",So glad we visited!,"Husband and I went during the week. It wasn't super packed but busy enough for queues to get to 45-60 min wait without express pass at certain points in the day. Because we like the more extreme roller coasters (and not fans of queuing in the humidity), we got the express pass unlimited. Longest queue we were ever in for any ride was 10 min. We went to Battlestar Galactica Human and Cylon rides first. With the express pass, we were able to ride both once before the rides shut down due to technical issue. They thankfully reopened later in the afternoon but had they not, we would have been very appreciative of having the express pass. The Waterworld show was fun to watch. This Universal Studios is quite small compared to the one in Orlando, so you could probably get through everything in half a day (with express pass). We rode everything multiple times (some rides many times) and found enough fun to spend the entire park opening hours there. The park gets noticeably quieter around 5 pm when families with small kids start heading off. The rides that require no bags or loose items will have free locker rental. The amount of free locker rental time is adjusted throughout the day in accordance with queuing time. For example for Human/Cyclon, at park opening the free locker time was 45 min. At 2 pm, it was 95 min. At 5 pm, it was 65 min. On rides where lockers are optional (i.e. Rapids), you will have to pay (i.e. $4 for 1 hour). We took a Grab car on the way there, and a taxi back to our hotel. Both Grab and taxi were about the same cost for two people as using public transportation, but took half the travel time and provided gloriously cool air con. Bring your own water...there are lots of drinking fountains but the water was low/warm/not great tasting. Buying water is $4 for a small carton. Don't run - witnessed lots of groups throughout the day running from ride to ride - you'll make it without running with time to spare on a weekday! Safety first!",Universal Studios Singapore
GDay1044,4.0,"January 16, 2019",Revisited,Vowed the second visit was the last but my stepdaughter in her 20's asked so nicely so back again - not that much has changed excepting the queues were longer - none of us are good extreme ride users so express passes were not a value option - we were not that frustrated excepting at the Jurassic Park Rapids ride the wait was estimated at 1hr 20 mins! - we gave it a miss - we did queue for 30 mins at the Sesame Street ride only to have it malfunction when were were about to board - such is life - in general however this is a fun filled venue busy any day of the week come rain or shine - no food allowed in but we found prices were reasonable with generous portions so no complaints there - I suggest an early arrival and if you are an adrenaline junkie go for the Express Pass - expensive but it will save over 3 hours of standing waiting - getting there is by MRT to Harbor Front and then enter Vivo City to get the Sentosa Monorail - I have said this in other reviews if you are two or more consider a taxi - you are dropped at the bottom of the escalator that comes up next to the Universal World rotating sign - a door to door aircon ride and not that much more expensive.,Universal Studios Singapore
Graham L,5.0,"January 16, 2019",Great fun day out,We've been to Universal Studios a few times now. The rides and attractions cater to the whole family. We used express tickets and found them extremely useful. Favourite ride was the Mummy but Transformers was too jolty.,Universal Studios Singapore
Ms.Placibe,5.0,"January 16, 2019",FUNtastic!!,"I recommended to buy tickets online,to avoid queues. Much more convenient (and being a member of RWSInvites is also a plus since you get to have wifi connection and discounts,just a suggestion since its not a free membership)  I fell inlove with this place for the sole reason ,that when we went it’s not as crowded like the one here in JP. 15-30 mins wait for almost every attraction is heaven! Those who loves to go to Disney or Universal would understand what i’m trying to say. You don’t need to actually pay extra ,since the waiting time won’t take hours.  Maybe we’re really lucky, we get to ride every attraction i had in mind by mid-afternoon because i was comparing it to those attractions that we have here.  It was really lovely,we will definitely go back in the future",Universal Studios Singapore

Stuart S,4.0,"January 16, 2019",Just as expected,"Spotlessly clean, well set out, but overpriced food and merchandise. There’s probably no need to pay extra for an express pass unless you’re going at really busy peak times. The longest we had to wait for a ride was about 45 minutes. You will get wet on the Jurassic Park ride, but for $5 you can hire a poncho. Why they don’t just give these out as you board the ride is beyond me, and smacks of further money gouging. If you do get soaked, there are drying cabinets at the end of the ride, but they slug you $5 for that as well. All in all an enjoyable day, the rides are ok but not many for adrenaline junkies. Really enjoyed the Shrek 4D and the Transformers ride. The roller coaster could cause you to lose your lunch so plan your timing on riding this. Worth a visit but a day is more than enough.",Universal Studios Singapore

Rebecca W,5.0,"January 16, 2019",Smaller than other Universal studios but still excellent and tonnes of fun.,"If you're staying in RW sentosa i.e. next to universal studios on the island - its well worth buying the 6 month season pass with universal express which allows 1 entry per day. It ends up costing just over 2 days admission with unlimited express, and while you don't get unlimited express entry (just once per visit) it means that you can just keep going for half days throughout your stay on Sentosa island and just ride each ride once (express) per entry! We purchased the season pass in advance and then on the first day we used the printed ticket to enter the park and then went to the membership office to convert the pass into a season pass which was a credit card sized card with our photo on it (photos taken in the membership office and our passports required for all tickets incl kids to do this!). Make sure you do this on the first visit as the printed ticket is a single-entry ticket!",Universal Studios Singapore
Shahrukh Chowdhury,5.0,"January 16, 2019",Very nice place.,"I liked the universal studios Singapore. The only irritating part there is the very long queue to get into the rides. You have to wait in the queue for more than an hour sometimes. However, if you get the VIP ticket, you can get the priority to enter. But still there is queue as quite a number of people buy VIP tickets. I loved the roller coaster, The Mummy and transformers. Foods are way too expensive. Water costs about SGD7 for 350ml/500ml (can't remember). The entry ticket price varies from one website to other. But if you purchase ticket directly from the counter there is expensive, compare to the internet price. Better you purchase ticket online as some of the offers include transports.  If you want to try all the rides, it will take your whole day. There is no point going to universal studios at 8am. It opens at 10am. You can start at 9am after taking a nice breakfast. You can take photos outside and then wait in the queue to enter. Do not carry any food items with you as they through all food items. They check your backpacks at the entrance. But you can carry water bottle. And you must carry water bottle otherwise you have to spend quite a lot money on water.  Before going to queue for any roller coaster, make sure you get a locker. Otherwise you have to come all the way out to put your stuffs in the locker and be the queue all over again. The locker is free for 1st one hour I guess, then it's chargeable. So if you are travelling more than one person, take one locker and keep all your belongings and then after an hour or one ride get another locker with another person thumb print.  I hope the tips will help you to travel well.",Universal Studios Singapore
Anne B,3.0,"January 16, 2019",Very average,Went with my 12 year old son. He loved the 3 large roller coasters. Not much else to do in way of rides for older kids. No drops or rides like dream works in Australia to excite him! He did enjoy the climbing wall. Lines were long 2 hour wait for Jurassic Park rapids so didn’t bother. Canopy flyer also long and broke down.  If you don’t have long in Singapore don’t bother too many other great things to do . Expensive for so few rides they have also very hot.

Mia,5.0,"January 15, 2019",Excellent day experience,"Universal Studios Singapore is excellent value for its admission price. The queues for rides differed in time based on the popularity of the ride and time of the day; e.g.: the Battlestar Galactica 'Human' ride took over 1.5 hours in the afternoon, whereas the Mummy ride was only 10 minutes near 6pm.  The main issue with the park is one expected of every park; food and drinks are overpriced (but not when considering prices in other theme parks).  I recommend using a pin when accessing a locker as fingerprints are removed from the system once your session expires; we needed to ask for it to be opened by a worker but they were excellent in their service (as most employees were).  If you were to go in a busy season, I recommend paying the extra money for an express pass to make the most of your day and access more rides (especially if you have children or large groups).",Universal Studios Singapore
obistevekenobi,4.0,"January 15, 2019",Great little theme park,"Brought our 6, 4 and 1 year old's here for their first visit to a theme park (I've previously been to the studios in LA and Orlando). It's a great size for their age - not too big and not too small!  Some feedback; + the food isn't as overpriced as Disney + wait times change a lot and it's easy to nip back to a ride + parts are covered to help with the rain  - the picture opportunities stopping mid queue upsets the little ones - it's not easy to cool the kids down - the fans in the queues don't have mist  ~ If they're under 1m in height they may have issues on some rides",Universal Studios Singapore

There are so multiple show so check timings and plan accordingly. Some rides get suspended last minute too which is quite annoying but than that’s for our safety only. There are some scary roller coasters too. The toddlers will love Madagascar, Star Wars and Jurassic park.  Tip: wear comfortable shoes and clothes because there is loads of walking. Don’t forget to pick some cute souvenirs for your loved ones.",Universal Studios Singapore

Rupali A,5.0,"January 15, 2019",Lovely place for kids,A must visit in singapore. Rides for all age groups. Best ride was transformers. Although it is tiring to go from one rode to another and stand in long queues for waiting at the rides,Universal Studios Singapore
Dalbir_S_Virdi,5.0,"January 15, 2019",Memorable time at the Park,"Though I have been to Universal Studio in the past at Orlando (USA), they always have something or the other new to offer. My recommendation would be ""Shrey"" and ""Transformer"". Apart from the Roller Coaster rides, we managed to visit most of the studios and enjoyed the shows. A day's visit is not enough. you need at least 2-3 visits to do full justice to the park.",Universal Studios Singapore
Suzi,5.0,"January 15, 2019",Fast Pass OR go early,"We went to Universal Studios with our children (13,12,9) early and purchased fast passes. We lined up at 9.30 am and were amongst the first to enter. We went straight to the popular thrill rides and did all of these except Lost World ride by 10.30am. Lost World opened later and we queued in fast pass line for 25 mins. If you didn’t want to re-ride the big thrill rides and were planning to arrive and line up early, then a fast pass would not be necessary. We went back on the popular rides again but partly just to get the value out of our fast passes. It is smaller than LA Universal Studios and not as many shows/tours. A few hours with the fast pass was plenty of time there.",Universal Studios Singapore
Dan B,5.0,"January 15, 2019",Universal Studios,"Fantastic park, we were with my 10 year old son and he was able to ride on all the rides. Food and drink offerings were very reasonable compared to experiences at other theme parks. I would recommend the express pass as the queues can get quite long, we didn't and regretted it.",Universal Studios Singapore
ptd16,3.0,"January 14, 2019",Lots of queuing and not much doing,"Prepare to spend the whole day here. A LOT of walking so bring loads of sunscreen. The rides are okay, but the queues can be very long (over an hour for some of the rides). The estimated waiting times are also optimistic, expect to wait up to 50% longer than what it says on the displays. The food is mediocre, I don't know if you can bring your own food in though (they did check bags on entry but I don't now what for). Overall the kids liked it, just not as much as I expected.",Universal Studios Singapore
Clodruss,3.0,"January 14, 2019",Try to go on a weekday,"Avoid the weekend as it can get quite full. go early to avoid the heat and the crowds. buy your tickets online and show them on your smartphone. get a stamp and eat outside the park, more choices and less price. although all of Sentosa is very expensive. for teens there are limited rides, maybe 5 and they are mostly roller-coasters. we have gone once but most likely not a second time. as the rides are limited the older the kids are. there is only so many times you can ride a roller-coaster without getting sick...",Universal Studios Singapore
Doroted,3.0,"January 14, 2019",Just fun,"Have been once would not return . It s nothing else than a luna park . The rides are limited , the food as usual in this kind of place is junk.

arleen b,5.0,"January 14, 2019",EXCELLENT FAMILY EXPERIENCE,"It's a must visit place for individuals, couples, and family members. This place has a lot to offer to everyone.

Must go for all.",Universal Studios Singapore
KiwiTraveller43,5.0,"January 13, 2019",Wonderful,This is a really good theme park. Two tips: get the express ticket to go to the front of the queue. Otherwise you could queue for an hour in the heat for some rides. Also the grill in the New York area does surprisingly good food for a theme park,Universal Studios Singapore
Neo,5.0,"January 13, 2019",Great Fun,It was great fun to start 1st of Jan 2019. Lots of rides and places to see. We spent whole day there yet could not get enough with it. We enjoyed the most Transformers and Revenge of the Mummy rides. 4D Shrek experience was amazing. Water World show was splendid. Enjoyed the shopping in the end.,Universal Studios Singapore
Blokks,4.0,"January 13, 2019",Get there early!,Great fun for all. Recommend that you get there early to beat the crowds.

I guess it’s okay,Like I said if you’re going with young children then sure it’s a place to go to but for adults I would say no not much to see extremely overpriced and I didn’t enjoy it at all. Just an extremely overpriced Disney World,Universal Studios Singapore
cath_Spore,5.0,"January 12, 2019",High adrenaline trip,"Kids (14 and 10) loved the park with all the rides such as transformers, revenge of mummy (pitch dark roller coasters) etc. Express pass is not cheap but is worthwhile to get most of your day. Trick is look for rides and shows like water work, in between the roller coaster rides to calm yourself down. Singapore is warm but water cooler is available at every toilet stop. Food and drinks are relatively more expensive than those available out of theme park (can of coke is $4) suggest to buy a bottle of mineral water in and refill along the way. If possible, bring a change of clothes and /or poncho ( for some rides and in case of rain)",Universal Studios Singapore
Cristina G,5.0,"January 12, 2019",Fun fun fun!,"A fun place as expected! Thankfully it was not so crowded during my visit as it was on a weekday. One should try all the rides especially the iconic Mummy, Rapids Adventure and Transformers; as well as watch all the shows especially Waterworld! The show was as not as great as the one in LA but still worth it!",Universal Studios Singapore
Steven Kjaer,3.0,"January 12, 2019",Fast Passes Saved the Day.,"The fast passes make an excursion here very expensive but, in my view, necessary if we were to avoid significantly long queues (especially in the first half of the day). It wasn't super busy when we were there but folks were waiting over an hour to ride popular attractions. I don't think this is acceptable with young children. For older kids (8+) there are only about 6 interesting/thrill rides.",Universal Studios Singapore
76yessyy,5.0,"January 12, 2019",Fun for kids and adults alike,They provide rides with good mix for small children and adrenaline chasing adults. Very enjoyable and hassle free to purchase the tickets (since we went on low season there weren't any long lines),Universal Studios Singapore
Tara L,5.0,"January 11, 2019",Good rides but gets crowded. Go early,"We did this on the last day of our Singapore holiday. By then I realised the locals all sleep in and you need to go early. We got to the gates at 9.30am ready to open at 10am. As soon as they opened the gates (actually a few mins before advertised 10am) we ran to the rollercoasters. The first 3 rides had zero queue. Jurassic world opened at 11am so we made sure we were first one of the canopy ride. By lunch time the wait times were 1 hour for all the good rides. If you go, you must begin at 10am sharp and rush through all the good rides first. Plan with the map where to go so you don't waste time. If you are going to start later and don't plan I don't think you will like it unless you really enjoy standing in lots of queues in the heat. We left at 12.30pm having done most rides we wanted.",Universal Studios Singapore
Naireman A,4.0,"January 11, 2019",Not As Nice.,"We had express passes which really weren’t needed given the fact that they didn’t have many rides to begin with. Which is why I only gave this 4 stars. Over all it’s a very nice entertaining walk, with shops, dancing and characters all over. My favorite ride was the transformers 3D ride it was so fun and entertaining! And the Sherk show is a MUST! You won’t be hungry while here because they have so many restaurants that are literally walking distance. Unfortunately, it rained while we were there, which brings me to my point that the staff there actually walked through the park to make sure everyone had a plastic full length rain coat, free of charge!",Universal Studios Singapore
soluna t,5.0,"January 11, 2019",feels young,we travel in singapore and universal studio is on our list..its really fun there and worth the wait in long line for the rides,Universal Studios Singapore
ZiyaadErnie,5.0,"January 11, 2019",Worth the money,Remember to enter using the cable way. Great views. Also remember to pay the extra money and take the express pass. Lines to activities can be long. A wonderful experience and lots to do. Make sure that you allocate a full day for universal studios.,Universal Studios Singapore
Kausar Wali,4.0,"January 11, 2019",Adventurous Tour,Universal Studio of Singapore is one of main attraction for tourists. I already visited Universal Studio of Los Angeles in USA so this one is very small place as compare to that but it is nice to visit and enjoy one full day. Visit is hectic and full of enjoyment specially for kids and families and thrill seekers. We enjoyed all the rides though waiting time for each ride is long. Most attractive is big rollercoaster and 4 D rides and movies. Because of Christmas and New Year gathering and fun is many more.,Universal Studios Singapore
Shaileshak,5.0,"January 11, 2019",A must for kids & adults,"We had a whole day spent at Universal from the opening till the closing time, still we were left wanting for more.

We watched the closing time parade with Christmas celebrations & Santa.",Universal Studios Singapore
Cheryl P,5.0,"January 11, 2019",Action all day,Loved our visit to Universal Studios - line ups weren’t too bad & there was plenty of space - not as crowded as other fun parks we have been to before. Plenty of options & different types of shows/rides for all ages.,Universal Studios Singapore

Universal Studios Singapore has lots of amazing rides (over 20 different rides) but long queues for many, real-looking sets for movies, shows, themed zones, lots of dining options, and much more.

Staff are very friendly and helpful.",Universal Studios Singapore

Mike W,3.0,"January 10, 2019",Good but expensive,"Universal studios make a nice day out but expensive for entry and refreshments when inside. The rides are quite good but in reality you would find more in a theme park. A big minus is the express ride system, I find it quite sad that they employ a 2 class ride event. You can be waiting ages for a certain ride while others who have admittedly paid more jump to the front. Not good in this day and age.",Universal Studios Singapore
Mohamed Eltantawi,5.0,"January 10, 2019",Amazing,"Very enjoyable place, full of breathtaking thrilling games and interesting movie based compartments, One very important tip: buy the golden ticket to skip very long queues in games, and don’t forget to buy souvenirs.",Universal Studios Singapore
benjyboy81,5.0,"January 10, 2019",Excellent experience,"As SIngaporeans, we had never visited the USS before so the trip on 10 Jan 2019 was something we were looking forward to. Bringing four kids (aged one half months to 6 years old) was challenging (given the Singapore heat) but overall the visit to USS was a very pleasant experience. Pros: - Very good toilet facilities. having lots of water coolers all over the park helped saved a ton of money as we did not have to buy the pricey soft drinks. - Going at a off peak period, it was generally enjoyable as the smaller rides were empty. This is very good for families with young kids, generally we did not have to wait more than 5-10 minutes (without express pass). - Park was stroller friendly and the generally small size of the park meant that we could revisit places we missed pretty easily. - Friendly staff and the ""child swop"" option allowed us to take turns to join our kids on certain rides without having to queue all over again.  Tips to enjoy the park - Bring a water tumbler. Given the hot Singapore weather, you will need to top up your bottle at least 4-5 times a day. Having a water tumbler saves money on buying pricey soft drinks. - The food in the USS premises is very expensive, just go out of the park to eat and you save at least $5-$6 per meal. It takes less than 15 minutes to reach the entrance from the farthest point of the park. If you are like us with a family of 6, you get to save at least $40-$50 just by walking a little more - Have a late breakfast or eat something substantial before you go into the park (assuming at 10am). That way you can have your lunch about 2-3pm in which you are able to avoid the sizeable lunch crowd. - If there are certain rides you want to take but couldn't because of the long queue, go during the water world show (at 1pm or 415pm) as that the period where many visitors are watching the show thus considerably shortening the queue at those rides.",Universal Studios Singapore
Georgia C,5.0,"January 10, 2019",Such a great time,"I love universal studios so was so excited to see they had one in Singapore (since i used to live there and it wasn't there when i was there). And i was not disappointed - the rides were great fun, the wait times weren't too bad and the prices were also fine. I thought the rides were really well done too - universal has a knack for making the themes really good. I'd suggest spending the extra $30 on express passes as it's not that much money and does significantly shorten wait times.",Universal Studios Singapore

We bought the ticket online and really have great time despite there were many people because it's holiday but still love the great entertainment of this place. The long queue didn't kill the fun,Universal Studios Singapore
Sabrina,3.0,"January 9, 2019",Ok.,"We tried to avoid the peak times and went early on the morning on a working day. At the very beginning it was still possible to access the rides quickly. Later the day the wait was up to one and a half hours for the beat rides. That was also due to the fast track which does not cost too much, if I remember and allows you to skip to the front of the line. I get the point, but it was super annoying, especially due to the locker system. They want you to put backpacks into lockers. Depending on how busy the park is, the time varies (more time for free in the evening). You get like 45 min for free and if you’re not back in time, you have to pay for rent and it’s not too cheap. The problem is, I left my cash and cards in the locker and due to long lines took longer than 45 min. A nice gentlemen lend us a couple of dollars to get the stuff out and then we could pay back. Annoying.  To my surprise the food was reasonably priced, I have seen worse in amusement parks.  Some cool rides but not worth the wait. I guess that was my first and last visit.",Universal Studios Singapore
Dean S,5.0,"January 9, 2019",Fun all the way.,"We visited on 31/12/18 and although it was very crowded and the regular wait lines were long, up to 2 hours, we luckily has the express pass and never waited more than 10 minutes. If you're considering an Express Pass, and lack patience standing in lines like I do, then go ahead and get one. For the rides recommend the Transformers 3D ride as a 'must do' and for families - Shrek 4D. Despite the heavy rain in the afternoon the Battlestar Gallactica roller coaster kept running and although by the end of it I was soaking wet I was more than satisfied with the SCARE factor. This is not a cheap day out but it is one you will remember for a long time to come.",Universal Studios Singapore
Josie O,5.0,"January 9, 2019",Great time!,"We loved it! If you ever been to any other of the Universal parks, it's pretty much the same just a little smaller version. The rides & shows are awesome! It's a great fun time! 😁",Universal Studios Singapore
Herlotus,2.0,"January 8, 2019",My son's rating of USS - last on his list of places in Singapore,"We visited USS on 29 Dec 18.. The long queues at every show/ride was at least half an hour, hence unbearable under the heat and high humidity. It was quite a tortuous experience for me. Though my son was able to acclimatize quite quickly to SG weather, but he did find the queues unbearably long under the heat. He enjoyed the Water World Show and the Merry Go Round. He said that the roller coaster rides were too scary for a 9 year old. We were not able to go to every show/rides because we spent so much time queuing up, and by 6 pm, my son was dead tired. I would have bought the Express ticket if I had known of the option. Of the places we went to in Singapore, he rated this place last. It was also the most pricey of all the places we went to. He liked the cable car trip to and fro Sentosa. Food: quite pricey within USS, you could have got cheaper option just outside the USS compound. We did not take the latter option because of the long queues at every show/rides. The queue may not be quite so long outside Singapore school holidays - but will never find out as we will not be returning. The next day, we came to Sentosa again by train and he had a great time at the Pirate Ship water play at Palawan Beach, free entry. He told me that he enjoyed his time at the Pirate Ship much more than at USS. Food at Palawan Beach was cheaper. Good facility for kids water play here.",Universal Studios Singapore
Ronald F,4.0,"January 8, 2019","Great, pricey for South Africans","Universal is a must visit if you go to Singapore. It is quite pricey after ZAR conversion and if you opt for the fast passes, which does make a difference. We have been 4x times in the last 5 years and every time the park has been busy. This time as result we took the fast pass option unlimited. It works great and the kids did multiple rides on the same coasters. The Battlestar Galactica Cylon is the best. Got a normally grumpy teenager to smile for a day, so worth the premium.",Universal Studios Singapore
Gaurav Verma,5.0,"January 8, 2019",One day isn't enough,"I was here on 31st December and I would say what a fine way to end a year and what a beautiful way to start a new year. Entered with park opening at 10:00 AM and left at 12:00 midnight when park closed, yet I missed so much - true one day isn't enough to explore the park, even with express pass, especially when you are with 4 year old kid and have to swap kid for certain rides with your partner. Transformer, mummy, battlestar galactica - cylon were notably the best rides while my kid enjoyed madagascar and king julien merry go round. I was able to watch only one show and man what a show - Waterworld was like you were watching a movie being shot in front of you, of course without any retakes. For food there are plenty of options, Oasis was my choice because of vegetable options too. One could walk out of USS too for cheaper options but then that's a trade-off between money and time. Finally beautiful firework along with DJs was the best way to open your arms to a new year.  Tips: later of the day sees smaller queues everywhere especially when park is running for long hours. Ponchos are must on a rainy day and battlestar doesn't operate at such times. Taking a stroller is a very good idea with a little kid. Water is available everywhere to refill your bottle.",Universal Studios Singapore
Sara,1.0,"January 7, 2019",Totally sucks,"Ridiculously long queues of over an hour for nearly every ride. Very crammed waiting areas, with guests herded together like cattle in a slaughterhouse. Throw in the Singapore heat and humidity into the mix, and you have what I call an absolutely torturous experience. If you’re even more unlucky and have young kids in tow, prepare for some whining to go with the horror. Dining establishments are also very packed and food is overpriced. As a Singaporean, I’m seriously ashamed that the guests to my country are being tortured AND ripped off at the same time. And looking at the template responses from the management of this theme park, I can conclude that we can forget about any real improvement to the experience.  You have been warned.",Universal Studios Singapore

Vee1963,3.0,"January 7, 2019",Unimpressive visit sadly,"I guess the kids like this sort of thing but for me it was too hot and bothering to walk around in the heat for hours on end, gets very testing by the end of it. Lines miles long waiting for the attractions, i don't do lines well. In saying that there were two shows worth seeing but to me not value for money. The 4D place was worth the visit and water world show be warned if you sit close and low down you will get very wet. The line for the jurassic park show had 2 hour waiting lines so we gave that a miss so im not sure how that would have been.",Universal Studios Singapore
utkarsh3110,5.0,"January 6, 2019","Best theme park, but very crowdy","The USS is one of the best theme parks in Asia, that makes it only crowded and overcrowded at certain times, luckily during my Christmas visit, the park was kept open from 10-10 so could do the maximum of rides available. Its certainly not possible to cover up every thing so just relax and leave something for your next trip to the place. In case you are ina hurry then spend a bit huge bucks to get Express pass so that ytou can skip the queues at most attractions. The cost of that is almost double the normal price ticket and you need a normal ticket along with that too.",Universal Studios Singapore
Julia C,3.0,"January 6, 2019",Long waits,Great roller coasters but long waits! Very expensive for the amount of rides you get to do due to the queues! And the day we went was apparently not so busy!

Vicky Lomas L,1.0,"January 6, 2019",Didn't get on any rides,This was supposed to be the highlight if our trip to singapore. The ques for all the rides were 90 to 120 minutes long. I am not prepared to waste my time on standing for hours on end. Wish I had not bothered wasting my money. I wandered round for an hour and left. Think we were unlucky as it was the weekend between Christmas and New year and was probably one of the most busy days of the year. That said I do think they should entry limit numbers as waiting for 2 hours to go on one ride can't be anyone's idea of fun. Very disappointed.,Universal Studios Singapore

NatPR33,4.0,"January 6, 2019",Fun day out!,This place was a great day trip. you do need a full day! We got inside there around 12pm - I would recommend getting there earlier though if possible! The only reason being that our first two ride attempt we waited 1 hour and 20 minutes for!!!!! After that experience we went and bought express passes for $80 each. Had we not bought express passes we would have only got on about five rides. I’m not sure if it’s because of the time of year we went (3rd jan?) it was peak around 2-4pm. Crazy busy. Most rides were in excess of 60 minutes wait. With the express pass about 10- 20 mins wait. Although the Jurassic Park one was 1/2 hour and for non express 1.5 hours!!  I loved the Egypt part and the mummy ride!!! Very fun!!  The transformers was very good too!  We did watch the 4D shrek film which I found very cool too!,Universal Studios Singapore

captk2071,4.0,"January 6, 2019",Same but different,"We went to USS expecting to spend a whole day there but in the end we left after a few hours. There are certainly a number of decent rides and queues do form early straight after park opening. However, the heat is a real factor. You get a bit unenthusiastic after awhile for joining long queues. Maybe locals can handle it better. Individual mileage will differ for overseas visitors. You can purchase an express pass once inside the park to skip queues but on the day of our visit, it was S$70 extra which was only a little less than the normal park admission. You really have to want to ride those rides multiple times to justify that amount of money. Word of advice, queue up for transformer ASAP. You can also re-enter the park multiple times (just get a stamp) so you can go out, get lunch at the gentrified hawker centre and then go back in. The park feels smaller than the one in LA or is it just more compact?",Universal Studios Singapore

First ride we did was Transformers and we had a 40 minute wait. In hindsight we should have done this ride later in the day when wait time for this and the Mummy were both under 10 minutes. We did all the rides, peak time was 1-3. Food expensive and we could have taken food in as no one checked our bags but it is a risk that you take. Our 10 year old loved his day here and we are glad we came. I wouldn’t waste money on the express ticket but do be prepared to wait for the larger roller coasters.",Universal Studios Singapore
brisgasman,3.0,"January 5, 2019",Queue Jumpers Galore! But Cylon and Human are excellent,"We had an enjoyable day, able to see everything in the park and have a single ride on each attraction in 8hours.  Undoubtedly, Battlestar Gallactica: Cylon vs Human is the main attraction and both are excellent - exhilarating and fun. Be aware that your pockets need to be empty (no phone, wallets, etc) and there are lockers nearby for storage.  Be wary of queue jumpers: many large families (5+) individuals saw it as their right to hold a position in the line for all members with one individual. On the “Puss in Boots” ride, this resulted in our family moving further away from the head of the line. Our polite objection seemed poorly received and USS staff did not intervene.  The division of express and non-express (same as fast pass at Disney) card holders on to rides was arbitrary and inconsistent. The was no fixed rule on any ride (don’t worry, the waits were long enough to make a fair assessment with a reasonable sized sample).  Smaller families should not be disadvantaged by larger ones!  I’d give the rides 5 stars if I could.",Universal Studios Singapore
Davidl50,4.0,"January 4, 2019","Fun, busy and enjoyable","A fun place to head to for a family visit. Only reason not five stars is because two shows we went to see had technical difficulties (one show which had to be paused, the other completely cancelled). Not that many options for smaller kids (good to check before going - see pic below) but ours found plenty to do nonetheless (3&5). Queuing times were typically 40 minutes unless you bought an express pass, which I’d recommend if you want to go on the popular rides and time is against you. Clean, well maintained, fun family day out. Would recommend.",Universal Studios Singapore
Mehru,3.0,"January 4, 2019",Must visit in Singapore,Its a must visit place in Singapore. The entry is about 80 SGD. There are some nice amazing rides and a water park. I didn't enjoy it much because probably I've been to the Universal in America and Disney and Wonderland in Canada as well. Its super small compared to the rest of the places. Still a must visit while in Singapore.,Universal Studios Singapore
Lyzappy,4.0,"January 4, 2019",Fun but pricey,"My parents and I went to USS last Decemberand for our Christmas Vacation. We went there at noon upto 9pm but I got to ride 7 attractions - Battlestar Gallactica (Cyclon) being my first, my favorite and at the top of my list in rides. Another favorite show was Waterworld- it was amazing! The actors, the explosions and stunts made us go WOW! Plus it was fun seeing people getting wet (good thing I was only on the splash zone). All time favorite show. 3rd fave was Jurassic Park adventure, but people on the ride I was with got extremely wet. They had to change clothes or use the dry pod for SGD 5. Ponchos are for sale for SGD10 lockers for rent for SGD 4 for an hour. Some attractions though, like the mummy and have free lockers for an hour. Both attractions are pretty strict, no bags, or phones or wallets in your pocket.  Cons: the street show was okay but not as magical as TDR. We saw them for only a few minutes and they stopped at a place where a lot couldn’t see the performance. Many things were expensive- food and souvenirs (SGD 2 for a penny and about SGD 35 for a USS shirt). My parents who are about 60 wasn’t able to ride attractions just watched the shows. But they enjoyed walking around.  Overall, it’s a great way to spend time.",Universal Studios Singapore
Inspiration544378,5.0,"January 4, 2019",Great Day Out,Was worried about queues as reviews all complained about wait times- not an issue - express pass worthwhile though. Park really clean - staff friendly and helpful. No complaints - thanks USS for a great day out.,Universal Studios Singapore

umar farooq khan hoti,4.0,"January 4, 2019",Amazing place but ques r way too long,Universal studio it worth seeing place specially with kids it has amazing rides but I guess we went in peak season where prriority tickets were made super expensive children loved the rides but for every ride that was worth trying U literally had to wait 90 mins or more so I’ll say amazing place but won’t recommend going without priority tickets and try avoiding peak season,Universal Studios Singapore
celia_pankhurst,4.0,"January 3, 2019",Fun and great shelter in the wet season!,Armed with our map and fast pass (which I highly recommend at an additional cost of $110 per person) we made our way around the theme park. The heavens opened up after lunch and the rain came down but there was plenty of covered areas and restaurants galore to take shelter in.  I wouldn’t however recommend much of the food. It was expensive and unappetising.  Otherwise a great day out.,Universal Studios Singapore
Liam O,5.0,"January 2, 2019",Great,"Had a great time here. With young children there's always a fear that facilities/rides won't be appropriate. My children had fun in the rides, my wife and I had fun and honestly was one of our best days.",Universal Studios Singapore
Phatcat29,4.0,"January 2, 2019",Busy!,Great visit. The park times were extended for December from 10-10 as the park was hecticly busy. Transformers ride was 90min waiting whilst the others were between 45-60 minutes waiting. Don’t expect it to be like Orlando. Much smaller. Park can be done in a day. Rides were great fun. Food and drinks inside is pricey.,Universal Studios Singapore
RonnC,5.0,"January 2, 2019",Miracle on a Peak Season,"We came on Saturday during a peak holiday season. So yes, we expect the USS to be jam-packed with people. And sure enough the visitors queueing on the gate were so many. We decided not to buy the express pass as it was crazy expensive. About 40% higher price than the tickets themselves. So yes, no express pass for us! And then miracles happened. Ride after ride we took with only 5 to 15 minutes waiting! After only 2.5 hours in the park we have covered half of the USS already! Even in the afternoon we queued for the Transformer rides about 30-40 minutes only! That's crazy fast, as people used to say it can take 90-120 minutes waiting! We spent only 8 hours in the park, having covered most rides, plus spending so much time resting and taking pictures! What a wonderful and miraculous visit! Thank God!",Universal Studios Singapore
Ukhwahfest S,1.0,"January 2, 2019",NOT WORTH IT,Visited On 2nd Jan 2019. Long waiting queue of about 45mins-1hour long eventhough we bought express pass for $110 per pax excluding entrance fee of $76 per pax.  Very expensive canned drink. $4.00 a can.  They should have limit the guest in.,Universal Studios Singapore
Demented_Em,4.0,"January 2, 2019","Good day out, but very expensive",We had some issues with out pre paid tickets . the staff on the helpdesk were very helpful and called the ticket providers to re send the tickets.  We upgraded to Fasttrack as the queues were crazy long. However even the fast track queues were long so kinda was a waste of time on some rides. The park really isn't that big. Though it does have quite a few rides. Not enough places to eat as we struggled to sit anywhere so we ended up going outside the park to eat,Universal Studios Singapore
f94os,1.0,"January 2, 2019",Too many guests - crazy waiting times,"120 mins wait without a fast pass, which is another S$80, and then 45 mins wait with, us simply not acceptable. How are you supposed to keep kids happy??",Universal Studios Singapore
piyush487,5.0,"January 1, 2019",Full on adventure,"Must visit attraction in singapore. The mummy and transformer rides are not to be missed. Pro tip - if you wanna skip the long queues here, ask for single rider options available in most of the attractions. This will divide you from your group or partner. But it will save a hell lot of time to explore more of the park.",Universal Studios Singapore
Leanne F,4.0,"January 1, 2019",Great fun!,We spent New Years Eve here - both day and night. The queues were shocking during the day and we contemplated the extra $440 for four of us for the Express Pass and so glad we didn’t bother. There is not that many rides and if you are patient you get on. We came back at 10pm and literally walked in to every ride so managed to do some of the main ones twice! We did have the advantage of the park being open to midnight due to NYE so overall a good experience. Food seems to be an issue in Sentosa with all venues full and quite small. Food courts are disgraceful with dirty tables and not enough seating.,Universal Studios Singapore
Rajesh Ag,4.0,"January 1, 2019",Fun for kids,"1. Go for solo line. Your turn comes faster. 2. Go for Transformer, mummy, Jurassic park. If adventurous then can go for roller coaster ride. 3.

Pioneer749079,5.0,"January 1, 2019","Great Fun on NYE, great theming","This is my first time in Singapore and I had a great time going on pretty much all the rides there. I also stayed for the new year's fireworks which were a nice way to ring in the new year. Some tips for travelers who want to avoid crowds: 1. GO EARLY. Most people don't rock up to the park until 1-2pm or later which is peak time. The park opened at 10 and we were lined up at 9:30. We did an entire circuit of the park and the main big rides (the mummy, both battlestar galactica coasters, Jurassic park, shrek) plus watching the waterworld show and were done by 12:30 with wait times a max 10min. So get in early and you don't wait much at all.  2. Bring an umbrella because there may be thunderstorms and you will get wet.  3. Don't bother with ponchos for the Jurassic park ride as you barely get wet and they charge you $5 for them.  4. Consider where you are - burgers are the only western food options and all the other food is beautiful unless you don't like Chinese, Indian or Malaysian cuisine. Also it's theme park food so obviously it's more expensive than usual.  5. Do intense rides at the start of the day because you're more likely to get motion sickness when you're tired and/or full so get the roller coasters and the transformers ride done early.",Universal Studios Singapore
karenthevn,5.0,"January 1, 2019",Fantastic fun,"We purchased a 6 month season pass with express as it was the most cost effective way for a 2 day trip and I’m glad we did. The fast pass was essential with young children and it allowed us to ride everything we wanted each day. The park is clean and well maintained, there were a couple of break downs on the rollercoasters but the staff handled the situations well. The children aged 4, 10 and 12 had a blast watching shows, riding the various rides and meeting characters. The food and drinks are expensive in the parks but I guess it’s expected unfortunately. Overall a great trip and we will go back. It was a nice extra to see the Christmas shows and celebrations especially the street parade and snow effects that went with it.",Universal Studios Singapore
Corrie B,4.0,"January 1, 2019","Great day, not great food options","This Universal Studios is much more kid friendly than Hollywood. We bought express passes and it was an absolute lifesaver. On a hot, humid, sunny day, we cruised to the front of every line we wanted to enter, including the shows. The attractions were great. Unfortunately you aren’t allowed to bring your own food, and the food there is very wheat and meat focused, so I could only eat tater tots for lunch. My son ordered ‘nachos’ a bag of corn chips and a bowl of cheese sauce, the plastic kraft cheese kind. Not great place to eat. A fun day though, maybe 5 hours worth of joy with no queuing.",Universal Studios Singapore
Susan Tan,5.0,"January 1, 2019",A must visit !,"This is a must visit place in Sentosa Singapore!

Mackay280,4.0,"January 1, 2019",A good option for New Years Eve with kids,We chose to come New Year’s Eve as we have 3 teen age kids. It was a really good choice though an expensive one. We booked a return van transfer as we were concerned about getting there and back during New Years. This cost us $170 sgd return for 5 people. The journey there was really smooth and I would now suggest grab a taxi instead of a booked transfer. We left for the park at 4.15pm. We purchased the ‘after 5pm ticket package’ so couldn’t enter the park until after 5. The park was already busy though with day time guests. The park itself is good but does lack a lot of rides for teenagers. There’s really only 4 that I would class as ‘adult’ type rides. The food at the park is awful. Really expensive and if you prefer western food there is very limited choices and the choices there are very ordinary. We bought the unlimited fast passes which cost an additional $100 per person and I didn’t think this represented very good value at all. Most of the rides you wouldn’t want to go on a second time apart from the big roller coasters. Waiting time at the most was around 45 mins for normal pass holders but it was good getting the fast passes to save time. It depends on how long you want to wait for a ride as to whether a fast pass is worth the extra $$. As we’d booked a return transfer we arranged to meet him at the Michael Hotel lobby which is right near the park and this was a very easy and simple location to get into and out of on a busy night. We did have a good night and the kids really loved the park. It is a really good option for kids on New Years Eve.,Universal Studios Singapore
Peter S,5.0,"January 1, 2019",Compact enough To Do In One Day,"It's a theme park that's ""do-able"" in one day. Even with the extra $100 ticket to get an ""Express Pass,' a couple of the best rides do not accept it and you end up in a queue that can take up to an hour to get on the ride which lasts maybe a couple of minutes. Best tip is to turn left inside the entrance to Madagascar and start the ride there, that means you;ll be in time for the Waterworld live show, which was amazing. This counterclockwise movement at least gets you on some less crowded rides. Jurassic Park is very popular you could pass through Madagascar and Waterworld and turn back. Taxis are very cheap in Singapore but there are a load of ways to get to Universal. Just remember there are a lot of pe3ople with the same idea as you! There are plenty of reasonable priced places to eat, didn't see a lot of spaces top bring food and most of the rides require you to leave all your backpacks at the start of the ride. There are some lockers but not every ride has one. There is only one ride the Cyclone Attack ride that pushes the boundaries. It's a park for younger teenagers and families and is not designed to shake your body up like a human milkshake.",Universal Studios Singapore
Brooklyn Wilson,4.0,"December 31, 2018",a place for fun,"best theme park in singapore, i think it’s the only one. it’s great for a family day out or a friends day out. really an environment for anyone. although young ones don’t have as many ride options. there are many different food courts. each food court to match each theme of the park. each food court has an average menu including choices for kids. i recommend getting an express pass, otherwise u spend half the day lining up.",Universal Studios Singapore

wondorousexperiences,5.0,"December 31, 2018",The best amusement park I have ever been to,"Universal Studios Singapore was the best part in my trip to Singapore. So many rides and shows made it even more special. Their were so many kingdoms like Sci-fi-city, Far Far Away, New York, Madagascar, Ancient Egypt, The lost world which had very exciting rides. The most amazing rides were Transformers the ride, Enchanted Airways, Jurassic Park Rapids Adventure, Madagascar the crate adventure and Canopy Flyer. The Revenge of the mummy ride was too scary and was really a thriller. The Battlestar rides were also really thrilling and would turn your stomach upside down. The best shows were Shrek 4D Adventure and Lights Camera Action. If you go to Singapore and do not go there you'll regret it. You can also shop for nice things there and click photographs with your favourite characters. It was absolutely amazing and is small so it can be covered in one day. After this wondrous experience I cannot give it less than FIVE STARS.",Universal Studios Singapore
pulkitpopli2004,5.0,"December 31, 2018",Singapore best outing place,"This is amazing and most hectic also. You should spend full 1 day with express ticket to save time. Buy ticket online by yourself to save money. You will end up doing a lot of walking v inside the park. Everything is well organized. I enjoyed christmas shows.  Water bottle can be filled at various places inside the park. Just keep your bottle with you. Vegetarian food is there but expensive. After every ride you will enter a zone where you can buy your picture clicked by their team or you will buy the merchandise related to your ride characters.  Bad part about USS - only 5-6 rides are great/scary/adventurous, rest almost 20 rides are for kids.",Universal Studios Singapore
bluehive,4.0,"December 31, 2018",You WILL be short of time!,"I always assumed Universal Studios was for kids. It's not. This review is for the first time visitors and ones who have at least six hours to spare in Universal Studios. 1. Buy tickets online. You will save about ten dollars. 2. Reach early, may be by 11. 3. Carry minimum things with you. 4. Carry food and water, if possible. The studio's restaurants appear expensive. 5. The place is a roundabout route so you start from the entry. 6. There are free lockers available inside. The free time is about an hour. Locker security are of two types: fingerprint and secret info based. 7. If you are going in a group, you can use a new member to set up a locker. Otherwise locker fee is S$2 for 20 minutes. 8. Do ride roller-coaster. We did Cylon. Do it at the end of your trip because you will feel imbalanced after the ride. 9. Broadway Street is the most happening place here. 10. We did Madagascar ride, Shrek movie, Egyptian ride and The Lost World. Only Egyptian roller-coaster is good. 11. Outside the studio, there are many options for food. You can skip eating inside and pick the restaurant outside. It's cheaper and less crowded. 12. We missed the Transformers ride. It is supposed to be the best. Please do try. 13. To go home by MRT, walk to the Merlion and take the mono rail. Else you will have to wait in a long queue at Universal Studios. 14. There're food options for vegetarian and Indian vegetarian inside the studio.",Universal Studios Singapore

The best experience was with transformers ride.  Surprise ride was at the Egyptian mummy showcase.  There are also 2 high speed roller coasters for the adrenaline seekers.  Note: It’s a great idea to buy express tickets else you would be waiting in line upto 1+ hour.  Also it would be great to start early.,Universal Studios Singapore

I have not been to a Universal studios before so I had nothing to compare it to and I really did not know what to expect. I would describe it as okay only, maybe one for the young. It was nice to walk around and see everything but the waiting time for all the shows and rides was approximatley 60 mins each time so it was not really value for money and so much time was wasted. It was far too busy so I would reckon there were alot of disappointed kids who did not get on what they wanted to. For me it was something different to do bit it would not be a must see!",Universal Studios Singapore
Adrian A,3.0,"December 30, 2018",Similar to other themed parks,"A credit to Universal Studios is the effort to set up parks and entertain. They run a clean show and the crowds on 28 December 2018 were a testament to the drawing power and attraction.  The reason for the average rating is the small size of the park compared to similar venues around the world.  Like many parks there are some draw card rides and events but most of the venue focuses on selling merchandise and food as the money spinners.  Understand the need to be profitable but with limited growth, long wait times on limited rides the overall park was bordering on over promise and under delivery.",Universal Studios Singapore
WestonTH,4.0,"December 30, 2018",Battlestar Galactica,"I'm a teacher working in a near by country and all the students go to Universal Studios at some point and rave about it. I took my gf and her daughter this holiday break and went to see what all the hype was about. Overall it was a good day out. The park wasn't as big as I thought it was going to be, but there was plenty to do to keep you busy most of the day. FYI: Weather, be warned if a storm come in, which happens a lot in Singapore, they shut down all the outdoor rides. Also I would recommend arriving early afternoon as the queues really disappear in the last couple of hours (at least they did in our 1 off visit). The best rides by far are the Battlestar Galactica rollacosters. After the storm, during the last hour of the parks opening time we had 0 waiting time for many of the rides, so we repeated rides or went back to worlds were the queues were really long during the day. As an adult I loved both Battlestar rides and I enjoyed the Transformers ride. Apart from that all the rides were a little short or very tame. I would suggest the park is for a younger family. A great day out but I wouldn't go back in a hurry.",Universal Studios Singapore

Definitely worth to buy express tickets (or unlimited express tickets if you want to visit attractions more than once), otherwise you spend hours in queues. Express tickets are very expensive (on top of an already expensive entrance fee). Both entrance tickets and express tickets can be bought either on line or at the entrance.

Troy S,5.0,"December 29, 2018",Check the weather before you go,This park offers a fast pass which isn't much more expensive then the standard park entry so I'd suggest getting this first of all. The park is set up very well and flows ride to ride but as suggested in heading check weather report as they'll shut down rides without notice if a lightning alert comes in which they did yet there was no lightning to be seen i was told by a staff member that they have a very large radius that if any alerts come in they'll shut rides so being that its in Singapore and we have storms a lot check weather .

Don’t take bags as the locker fees are insane and you’re not allowed to take to take them with you on the rides. I’d suggest wearing pants or shorts with zipped pockets for your phone, camera, spectacles and watches! The weather today was absolutely great. The reason I gave the park a 3 is that it was overcrowded so we didn’t get to go on all the rides. Also, some of the attendants are a bit unfriendly.

Erroline G,4.0,"December 28, 2018",Thrilling if it is not raining !,"We got there early so it was not overcrowded. The atmosphere is fun with different Christmas decoration. We tried the cylon and human rides which were amazing. But, be prepared to wait 2hours and pay extra money for the locker. Water points are available. The transformers are fun and the mummy ride is superb! Opt for single ride to beat the q as you can do the rides as many times as you want. However, it started pouring all the rides and shows were cancelled, it was very disappointing. Would recommend to bring a raincoat and dress lightly. Choose the outdoor rides first in case it rains. Food is reasonably priced. This is a great place for family !",Universal Studios Singapore

gaffer11,1.0,"December 28, 2018",Queue-niversal Studios,"We had a very frustrating and disappointing experience at Singapore Universal Studios. We’ve visited lots of different theme parks around Asia and this compared very poorly to the rest. I could go into a rant about how we felt that day, but I’ll limit it to a list of pros and cons!  Pros: - it looks beautiful and was very clean - well themed areas - the shows were great - Waterworld was awesome - lots of shade and seating - the food was priced quite reasonably for a theme park - there were a group of 4 singers in the street who sung some fantastic Christmas songs - full of energy.  Cons: - everything seemed to be about getting you to part with more money. Things like the monorail should surely be free. - queue times are a lie (double them) - you are forced to use lockers for your bags when going on most rides. You have to pay a lot for the lockers and the price balloons if you queue for a while. It’s almost like you’re paying an entrance fee to the park as well as paying for each ride - not enough vendors for drinks/food. 30 minute queues for a snack and 20 minutes queues just for a drink! Not good on a hot day. - for some reason, Single-rider queues were not open. Staff kept saying “they will be open later”, but we checked and checked but it never happened. No idea why they didn’t open them - frustrating. - we found that the staff were in general very rude through the day. Not what you would expect in a theme park where you usually have buoyant people who thank you and are willing to help. Instead, the staff often grunted at us or pointed. - express tickets were crazy prices - triple what we paid to get in. We’re not sure whether they were discouraging single-riders so that people would go and desperately buy express tickets to get on the rides - a conspiracy theory! However, the express tickets didn’t even seem to speed things up by much. We overhead a normal 85 minute queue (for a kids’ ride) would be reduced to 40 minutes for express - still a huge wait and unlikely to actually be under an hour. - we saw a lot of disgruntled children around the park and I daresay it was due to the lack of things for them to do. We felt really sorry for them. - drinks prices were expensive. For a hot country, they should be making more water fountains available. Other attractions in Singapore really focus on sustainability and encourage people to refill bottles with water rather than wasting plastic. - there was even a huge queue to get off Sentosa! Little tip, if you walk down to the next station along on the Sentosa Express, there are no queues there so you can hop on the monorail and get out of Sentosa quickly! - too overcrowded. Universal, please don’t let this many people in! Half the amount of people = double the fun!  I would really discourage spending a day here. Singapore has much more to offer. You’ll end up spending lots of money and have little to show for it in Universal. We were one of the first few inside the park and left at 4ish after the Waterworld show. I think we managed about 2 rides (The Mummy and a Transformers simulator) and saw the Special Effects show and Waterworld show. 4 things in 6 hours. Grim.",Universal Studios Singapore
Ooi Y,2.0,"December 28, 2018",Not so good first visit,"We visited today with the hope that it will not be a pack as as weekend. Well we were wrong.. it's was very pack and we did not buy any fast past , we did not managed to try so many games,mainly due to the and due long q. And also that there is not much activities suitable for my 3 year old son. Some of the queue can take up to 210 mins..and we just walked On food: the food is at least 3 times higher than outside food and many were serving process or fast foods..we end up eating nuggets and burgers for lunch and dinner..the kids meal come with the gift set , for today's its a container but the container was not able to latch when closed The toilets are not so pleasant too..it's wet with tissues all over, the garbage bins are full according to my wife when visiting the ladies. For me the males toilet was acceptable although there are some which was wet. The worst part is the staffs I saw ,.while queuing for a boat ride in far far land 4 young girls in their 7 to 9 was shouted by a staff for what the staff claimed that they used others fast pass. Instead of politely turn then down he shouted at them with question :"" is this picture in the card look like you ? Don't use others card and q here. You are taking other people place""..I know he might be right but just a simple reply to say that the fast pass is not transferable would be a better and polite way of replying? The 4 girls was so scared that they just ran out quickly .it is a bit embassaring too as they are quite a lot of ppl queuing at that time I too had my embarrassing moment when i had dinner at mel's drive thru.. I paid some 70 dollars for food and drinks and filling in my soft drinks at the self service machine. When i came over refill again one of the staff shouted at me that i did not pay 3 Dollar for refill. She is shouting from the far right counter while i was refiling at the other end..She shouted in front of so many people on the queue and so.many people refilling...I was so embarrassed that i follow her to her counter, on the far right. I apologise that i was not aware that refilling require to pay extra..i saw so many people refilling some with their own bottle and some even with the minion container they purchased hence I thought it was FOC I was asking her what is the fuss of shouting for a mere 3 dollar when she can just tell (and not shout)..her reply was rather simple, it it was written at the displace at payment counter, but seriously and humbly i did not see that. She then made me wait at the counter as she continue with they payment of the other customers before processing my payment ( imagine this.: she was taking orders from a customer when she saw me refilling , shouted at me and bring me to her counter , then continue serving the customer before attending to me: the 5 minutes was the most embarrassed moment of my life. After processing the payment she told me that i can continue refilling but I told her that i am not drinking this but I want to.prove a point that i was not doing that intentionally..",Universal Studios Singapore
Roo3,1.0,"December 28, 2018","Over-priced, disappointing day!","Ok, so we probably went on the wrong day (28th Dec) at the wrong time (arrived after noon), but we were so disappointed with our USS experience. I have been to DisneyLand Anaheim & Paris, Universal Studios in LA and Movie World in Queensland, Australia, and I would rate them way higher than USS. These places have much better systems for ride “queueing” and seem to genuinely care that their guests have a good time. That was not our experience at USS. The only thing we enjoyed was Lights, Camera, Action, and the WaterWorld show was pretty good. We chose not to line up for a minimum of one hour & twenty minutes for the “good” rides - some rides were a two hour wait (we don’t believe any ride is worth wasting that amount of time for) and also chose not to buy a fast pass for ONE HUNDRED AND THIRTY DOLLARS EACH!!!!! (And that was single use, multiple use was SGD160) What I have since found out is the fast pass increases in price depending on demand, obviously in VERY high demand the day we visited. Also, the service is incredibly SLOW. There appeared to be no sense of urgency at any place we bought food or drinks from, even though they had endless streams of people to serve. And as with most theme parks expect to pay double, if not triple, for food & drinks. So lessons learnt, do not bother going at holiday time, buy your entry tickets AND fast passes online BEFORE you get there, and don’t expect to be served quickly. Also remember in Singapore it is HOT!!! If I had my time again, I wouldn’t bother going. Very disappointing for our entire family.",Universal Studios Singapore

sallyc369,5.0,"December 28, 2018",Great Day,We loved it here - go early to avoid large crowds! Would highly recommend getting the fast pass for the rides - we were able to beat the queues and pretty much complete the park 10-3.  Only annoying thing is that you have to put your belongings in lockers at different points around the park when going on the big rides - these areas were manic but the staff were friendly and able to help you with the lockers and machines.,Universal Studios Singapore
jmca2000,4.0,"December 28, 2018",Good day trip with family - opt for single rider queue,"Plenty of rides based on Transformers, Jurassic Park, Madagascar, Shrek and other Universal movies. One cheat - opt for single rider queue wherever possible. This will help save a lot of time. The photos are over priced. Otherwise all the rides can be completed in one day even if it is crowded. Highlights are Battlestar Galactica and Transformers zones.",Universal Studios Singapore

Cemal36,5.0,"December 28, 2018",Amazing place,You want to stay in there longer because wait longer I recommend to you take express pass that is easy to get everything you will wait minimum time a little expensive but worth it I highly recommend here for everyone if you come to Singapore you have to visit universal studios I really come back here again,Universal Studios Singapore
Diane A,3.0,"December 27, 2018",Express tickets please,"Definitely a must see for kids. Bought tickets from the hotel and weren’t informed about express tickets (should have done our research). So families with young kids, please get the express tickets to skip the queues. In the afternoon we waited 70min for a 1min ride on the cyclone. We got very tired. Our highlight was Madagascar boat tour and the 3D show in the far away Kingdom 👌 I found the staff at the entrance of the Jurassic Park and Cyclone super rude. But not all of them hopefully. Standard queue at Jurassic also takes you through a compulsory photo shoot - not compulsory for express ticket holders though 🤔",Universal Studios Singapore
Peter W,5.0,"December 27, 2018",Amazing experience,We had a very hyped day. It's like we all turned to kids. Lots of rides and stuff to keep everybody happy.

GillyT,3.0,"December 27, 2018",Expensive and not as good as I was expecting .,Took our 2 young grandsons here as a treat. We paid for express as it was so hot on the day we visited and it was a lot of money. However we didn’t have to wait long which was a bonus. Surprising though the jeep ride in Egyptian area did not have an express line and we queued for a long time for a children’s ride. We did eat here at it wasn’t good but that is true of a lot of theme parks. We had been to the Universal in LA many years ago and this was not a patch on that. The staff were good though and very friendly but not sure the day warranted the very high price.,Universal Studios Singapore
Auswiz,5.0,"December 27, 2018",Magnificent experience,"This is a 5 day must for kids - it really requires at least that long to take it all in. Although far from inexpensive it is worth it, to see the kids faces just light up at every attraction.",Universal Studios Singapore
JPY,2.0,"December 27, 2018",Disappointed,"Sadly our trip to Universal didn't live up to expectations or previous experiences of other Universal resorts.  The rides were average, the queues no worse than any other theme park (approx 30-45 minutes per ride) but the resort was bland and had no extra sparkle - even the staff looked bored!  Had planned to spend all day here but left mid-afternoon as we'd seen enough. It's expensive to get in, so only come here if you've got loads of time in Singapore and want to fill up some of your time, if your schedule is tighter then don't bother, you won't miss anything.",Universal Studios Singapore

Beard and Sunnies,5.0,"December 26, 2018",There goes lunch!!!! - just joking:),"I must be in my second childhood, because lately I have been visiting theme parks. I was in Singapore last weekend with a friend, and we took the opportunity to visit Universal. Great choice! Not as expensive as you would think, because all ride fees are included in the price of the entrance ticket. Lots of rides and stuff to keep everybody happy, and got thrown around and screamed like a kid on some of them. Was struck by how patient people were - standing in line for 20 + minutes for a ride? No problem, just strike up a friendship with the folks behind or in front. And had a flash back to my youth with 'lunch in the diner'. All in all, a great day!",Universal Studios Singapore
Meegan P,5.0,"December 26, 2018",A fun day out for families,We had a great day out here. We purposefully chose to visit on a weekday to avoid big queues.

The staff were all friendly and went out of their way at the end of the day to get the souvenir that the kids wanted that was from another part of the park.,Universal Studios Singapore
Capt Aneja,5.0,"December 25, 2018",A must visit location at singapore,"Universal studios is one of the main attraction in Singapore with all the joy rides and performances.  Light camera action by Spielberg is good. For kids, Madagascar is good. And for all ages, transformers, Battlestar rollercoaster is awesome. Best 3D effects ever seen was Shrek movie, don't miss it.  Don't hurry up allot, if it is not vacation season, as 1000 hrs to 1830 hrs is quite sufficient. During peak seasons, u need to brisk walk a little in order to cover all.  A must go destination while in Singapore.  A tip for economical travellors....hope it will help....Food and beverages are costly, a usual 1.5 SGD soft drink can will cost 4.0 SGD, so carry some of your own because kids will ask 10s of them throughout the day :)  Thanks  Aneja",Universal Studios Singapore
Troy B,2.0,"December 25, 2018",Nothing Like the USA Universal Experience,Universal Studios Singapore is a very scaled down version of both Florida and California Universals. My family would compare the attractions to that of Disneyland ... much more catered to young children than an older demographic. The Universal Express pass is a must and adds over 100 Singapore per ticket. A family of four should expect to spend well over $750 for a day at Universal Singapore for mediocre food a handful of entertaining attractions. Not a chance I'd spend the money again.,Universal Studios Singapore
Amit,5.0,"December 25, 2018",Great place to go for one day !!!,We went Universal Studio and spent whole day at there. So excited to see all the attractions. A lot of places to see and play. The first Universal in South West of Asia. Hope to come back again. Tips: 1. Try to remain there till 7:30 PM to 8:00 PM in studio. One can experience day and night lights over there 2. Another advantage we saw is less wait time after 6:00 PM. In the day time it was crowded and reached up to 80 minutes but in evening it’s just 0-10 minutes.,Universal Studios Singapore

Whereswaly,5.0,"December 24, 2018",Get the fast track!,We enjoyed an amazing afternoon at universal studios. Definitely get the fast track upgrade as we could only be bothered to wait for x3 rides as wait times ranged from 30-50 mins. We enjoyed the Waterworld display and left 2 mins before the end to avoid the rush of people. Id also recommend taking an empty water bottle and refilling it around the park taps. We avoided food as it seemed a bit fast foody (you could maybe get something healthier in Starbucks?) and instead had cocktails at the hard rock hotel afterwards.,Universal Studios Singapore
EJStevenson,3.0,"December 24, 2018",Fun Day out!,"We had a nice day here, we did have to purchase express passes as we didn’t want to wait an hour for each 2 min ride, which wasn’t cheap but worth it. Kids enjoyed the rides and plenty of chain restaurants around for the family to eat in. It’s much much smaller than the one in the USA that we usually go to. I would say there’s nothing for smaller kiddies here. My two older ones 4 and 5 could go on a fair few things but there was nothing for our baby here as the baby ride is closed for service. There was a couple of little street shows going on and got them out of the hotel for a day. Worth a day out!",Universal Studios Singapore
Chandan K,5.0,"December 24, 2018",A place where you become child,Awesome place. Money they charged $80 is worthy. Too good experience. Especially the transformer 4D studio experience. I love it. Rides are so enjoyable & full of adventure & fun. Stunt performance was outstanding. 5 out of 5 for this place. One more thing. Don’t buy any special ticket. Buy the $80 ticket through which you’re admissible for each & every studio & ride. It would take time to make an entry but it’s cheap & best.,Universal Studios Singapore

Buying on the day itself costs SGD50 compared to buying earlier at SGD30. Ended up buying the unlimited express pass at SGD80 for everyone. Children who are exempted from entrance fees need not get a separate express pass if accompanied by an adult having one.  The weather was hot and humid, I recommend that you bring a fan and wear a hat.  Souvenirs sold were not as attractive as before.  Fun rides include Transformers and Revenge of the Mummies.  Purchases of kiddy meals at the restaurants get a free small lunch box for the children.",Universal Studios Singapore
soeedy_74,1.0,"December 23, 2018",The American ”rip off”,"I would not recommend visiting Universal Studios to anyone. We wasted a full day there. All you do is stand in line to the attractions. Even if you end up buying the Express access you often end up waiting an hour to get on to a ride. Those who don’t buy the express option will end up waiting at least twice the announced waiting time (1 hour = 2 h), so don’t believe those. If you can think of doing anything else while in Singapore I would recommend you prioritize that as you won’t do many rides at universal in a day and there are quite few of them.  There are much better amusement parks with better value for money (and better rides) in the world so go for those instead and do something else while in Singapore, which is a nice city.",Universal Studios Singapore

Be prepared to wait in lines much longer than anticipated (the USS queue times are unrealistic), so you’ll only get to go on the rides once (occasionally twice). As is typically of Universal, the fast pass is way overpriced and limits what rides you can go on.  At the end of the day.. with 2 teenagers, we had a reasonable/fun time..

Family of 5 costs $320 and basically the park is set up to keep draining you of money from the food and drink stations to the drying pods (??) to the lockers where you need to put your things whilst on rides, it goes on. I booked online at hotel and they kindly printed out for me. Arrived at 9.30 (opens at 10am) so we could be at front of line which we were. Then our tickets wouldn’t scan and despite having 5 tickets and invoice they wouldn’t let us in until a they referred to a mananger who eventually came over and then went and got tickets for us to scan through. By this time everyone was in and line ups terrible. By 1pm we had been on 3 rides (yes 3 rides!) and the line ups for other rides were approaching 2 hours. Worked out if we stayed we might get another 3 rides for rest of the day so we bailed. We had been on a 5 week holiday around Europe and without question Universal Studios was the worst value for money on the entire trip. Better value would be to head down to the beach or the waterpark.

Revenge of the Mummy - unforgettable moment. Far Far Away - a “live” show with the donkey and Shrek’s 4-D Adventure is so real.

Ancient Egypt - This zone had some very cool architecture and a cute jeep ride TRANSFORMERS The Ride: The Ultimate 3D Battle. - The transformers ride was just unbelievable and the best of the best :) we have entered the long queue three times to experience this wonderful ride.

Clive H,3.0,"December 18, 2018",Disappointing,We really looked forward to this day out but we’re disappointed not with the cost but just the park overall. It’s not a massive park and there are very few major rides so waiting times are long even on non busy days. Thus frustration is made worse by timings on display at each ride which are irrelevant when you go and it says 15 minutes and your in line for 50 minutes. Fast track is available but it doubles the cost of a one day ticket and you can only use it once per ride. We actually waited 45 minutes fir one ride and just as we were in sight if riding it broke down and staff just disappeared with an announcement of sorry it’s closed 😡  Don’t get me wrong some of the parks shows and certainly the actors are really good but doesn’t make up for the rest I’m afraid.,Universal Studios Singapore

Transformers The Ride and Battlestar Galactica Cylon were our favourites. Definitely for thrill seekers but there are plenty of attractions for young ones as well. There are plenty of places to eat and shop and cool down in the hot midday sun.  The park itself is relatively small but as we traversed the park and went on almost every ride we saw time flew by and we weren’t home till 5pm. Lines weren’t an issue at all on a Monday and some of the unique merchandise is a must buy.  Definitely worth a visit!",Universal Studios Singapore
Vasily,5.0,"December 17, 2018",Best destination on your Singapore itinerary,It feels like Disneyland on steroids: jaw-dropping themes and blood-curdling rides for the fans. Do visit the Waterworld.,Universal Studios Singapore
Langkau,4.0,"December 16, 2018",as good as theme park,"due to currency exchange, ticket is a bit pricey. went there on the weekend of the school holiday, not a very good idea. the water raft ride took us almost one and a half hour queue, not really worth it. got tricked by the queue, thought we have reach the embarking area just to found out that it only half way thru. it gets easier late in the evening. not much for child under 3 yrs old, not event for a very easy ride of sesame street. The best should go to the transformer ride. Food inside as normal as other Asian theme park, very expensive. sufficient toilets, cleanliness good. Parking max $28/day.",Universal Studios Singapore
navina,5.0,"December 16, 2018",Sentosa and Universal studio,"What a great day it was😆.Arriving at Sentosa we got to hold the parrots.We then proceed to a completely out of the world place...Universal studio.

Umakanta D,5.0,"December 16, 2018",Review of Universal Studio,"It is very pleasant place to visit, we have visited Saturday and which is weekend and lots of people come to visit on weekend. I recommend to visit this studio on weekdays where you will find very less gathering and people can take Maximum ride and people can have express ticket with cheaper price as ticket prices vary with demand and supply.  The ride were excellent, out of all rides transfermer ride and mummy ride I felt exceptional. Roller coaster ride very scary try to avoid in case of child, old and people with weeker heart.  Four D movie are good and children shall enjoy.",Universal Studios Singapore

justcruizen,2.0,"December 14, 2018",What does unlimited mean?,"Well universal studios have a definition. We bought general admin $72, then UNLIMTED access for a further $80. Only thing is there are 4 rides it doesn't allow express access. Either change your tickets or learn English.",Universal Studios Singapore
Lois,5.0,"December 13, 2018",Great day,"We visited USS on a weekday when it was open until 7pm, we arrived at around midday and this was the perfect amount of time. We purchased our ticket online and paid £40, we didn’t purchase an Express pass and didn’t feel like we needed it, Express lines were sometimes longer than normal lines. We done the big roller coasters at the end of the day and only waited about 10 minutes for each of them. All other rides were no more than a 15 minute wait. This is a good, new and clean universal studios.",Universal Studios Singapore
travellerstory12,4.0,"December 13, 2018",Enjoyable trip,"This is a place worth visiting if you are in Singapore. The kids loved the Sesame Street ride, while the Transformer ride was a thrill. You will need a day if you are aiming at taking most rides. Overall, it was an enjoyable experience for the whole family.",Universal Studios Singapore
dcadsm,5.0,"December 12, 2018",Go back to your childhood,"Great place. We arrived there early and walked around outside so much to look at. Gate open at 10 am. At 9:45am they start the warm up. A lovely old staff member told us to make a lot of noise when they say to do it and we may get a chance to win express tickets. Well we won them.  400 photos later we enjoyed ourselves immensely. Everything was very clean, staff were very friendly and the rides were fun. We went on ever ride. They have security lockers which you can pay $4 for an hour. The mummy ride was amazing we used our express tickets on that and saved about an hour of lining up. Go on a weekday a little quieter. On long lines we took on an average about 10 minutes waiting time.  I would take some nibbles because food is very expensive but that was expected because it is a themed park, it didn’t surprise us.  We had a afternoon lightning storm come through and that stops all outdoor rides due to safety. I am glad they thinking safety. There is lots to see when not waiting for rides. My family had a great time. Three teenage kids screamed enjoyably as their parents did all day on rides. Be prepared to get very wet on the Jurassic Park water ride. My wife got saturated but everyone laughed their heads off because we all did. Take shoes off in future wet feet all day. We laughed it off as part of the experience.",Universal Studios Singapore
Rory Parkinson,5.0,"December 12, 2018",Absolutely amazing !,"We loved Singapore and universal studios was spectacular, so clean I mean clean clean !

Shlomit K,4.0,"December 12, 2018",Nice visit,"Personally, I'm not a fan of roller coasters, but there are pleanty of other things to do inside. The Spilberg show is simply incredible, and the Shrek 4D experience is also very cool.",Universal Studios Singapore
atmaenterprises,5.0,"December 11, 2018",Awesome Stopover,"It is possible to take on Universal Studios Singapore, as a day stopover.  I do not recommend purchasing tickets to USS at the airport! We did and they were not valid. It was super stressful to get them validated. I had to contact the airport store, because the staff at the USS kiosk couldn't help me. We took a taxi from the airport to Vivo City mall and it cost about $30. On the 4th floor of the mall are ticket machines for the Sentosa express monorail. $4 a ticket. You can walk to Sentosa Island, but it is hot and quite a long walk. When you get outside of Universal studios to the right of the 'Iconic World Globe' are self service baggage lockers. $25 will get you a large locker for the day, that can easily fit 2 hand carry suitcases and a handbag- Take a phone photo of your locker number. There are certain rides where you have to store your loose items and they have lockers close to the ride entrances that cost about $10 for a limited time. The 'express ticket upgrade', is worth it. It doesn't cover every single ride, but most of the main ones. This ensured that we got to go on every ride in about 3 hours. Before you go on the Jurassic Park rapid adventure ride. Consider that you might get fully wet and whether that will be a problem during your stop over. Head to the gift shop close to the ride entrance. They sell rain ponchos for $5 that are USS branded and can become a great souvenir to take home. Remove your shoes if you can help it because they will get wet. Food is quite costly, but that's the case at every theme park I have visited. Certain stores had vegetarian choices which is awesome. Things to consider for your stop over- It is hot. I was drip sweating, just standing in line to enter. You are walking a lot. Lets face it, it's already exercise walking Singapore Airport. The USS layout, are rides around a central lake, so there is a lot of walking to get around to every ride. The 'standard' queuing lines can be long. I recommend researching which rides to attend first before they really get packed.",Universal Studios Singapore
Omarhasan2011,5.0,"December 11, 2018",Universal Studio Singapore,"Fantastic , awesome , bestttt . Such a wonderful family holiday place....you have everything all in one place.....we enjoyed as much as the children , felt like going again .",Universal Studios Singapore
MrNicoC,5.0,"December 11, 2018",So much fun,"It’s always a joyful time when at USS. The best rides are for sure The Mummy, Battlestar Galactica (Cyclops and Humans) and Transformers. Although quite expensive, do get the Express Pass - Unlimited. It will surely save A LOT of time.",Universal Studios Singapore
Arney,3.0,"December 11, 2018",Expensive,"My kids enjoyed the rides, the best being the cyclon roller coaster and the mummy. The interactive donkey live show was great for my younger sons. Please note, I have a family of five, I bought my entry tickets online, but could only get 3 unlimited express passes on the site and not five, they were 50 bucks each. On arrival to get the other two they got 80 out of me for each of them. Ouch! The passes made a difference in the middle of the day as you breeze pass the frowning faces in the regular queue to just ride anything without waiting. We visited on a Wednesday and by sunset the queues were gone anyhow. All in all, my family of five enjoyed the day, it was only my wallet that sustained an injury, and the cost with unlimited express passes, meals etc got me a little change out of one thousand Australian dollars.",Universal Studios Singapore
adventuresofkaymay,4.0,"December 11, 2018",Express Pass,"Visited here with unlimited express passes..... I cannot recommend these enough if you love the big rides. There was a few rides you could not use these on which was a shame. This park has water bubblers everywhere if you dont want to pay stupid amounts for a bottle of water. Another tip is purchase a drink bottle for around $25 and then refills are $3 soft drink and $5 for frozen drinks. If you dont want to eat in the park, outside the entry is Malaysian Food Street, with beautiful food and a reasonable price - just remember to get your hand stamped on the way out and rescan your ticket and show arm on way back in. The park was great and very family friendly. We spent close to a massive 10 hours here as they had the christmas parade and light up party. Pram hire for a double was $20 or $15 for a single one.",Universal Studios Singapore
Ravi S,5.0,"December 11, 2018",Leisure,What a wonderful place to visit in Singapore..it's a must visit for singles ..couples and family travellers as the place has got something for everyone..

Metalspree,4.0,"December 11, 2018",Good but can be great without the racist security,"Loved the place , please buy express pass inside the studios which is totally worth it ( you get to skip lines for rides). All the rides were great except for puss in the boots where the security was super rude to brown skin people for reason known only to him( minus 1 star ) for this.  This studios is the smallest in the world but yet it takes 1 full day to cover, both the roller coaster rides were great. Transformers 4D ride was just WOW",Universal Studios Singapore

The express ticket is too costly( $50 per person ).... since was raining went to the burger cafe near the theatre , don’t understand why paying $5 for soft drinks will have a better universal studio black cup but when ordering milo of the same price will only get a cheaper looking cup . Asked the staff but she said “is like that” . Would like to understand the logic behind !! Overall the rides were great",Universal Studios Singapore
Gedtayactac,5.0,"December 11, 2018",Singapore’s Most Awesome Place,It was a magical experience just like in the Movies. Time would be the only disadvantage because of the long line if you did not avail the Express pass. To experience all the rides it takes 2 days to do so. We really enjoy the transformer experience and also the Mummy indoor roller coaster. Highly recommended for people of all ages. Definitely will gonna give it a second Go.,Universal Studios Singapore
erikosultana,3.0,"December 10, 2018",Least Impressive Universal Studios,"Universal Studios is always fun, but this is one is quite small in comparison to the ones in the US.

Shamoz1,4.0,"December 10, 2018",Great day out,I would highly recommend going to visit universal studios of you are staying in Singapore. The price of the ticket is fair considering all the attractions that are inside. It would be a great place to bring small children for the day. Go early in the morning to avoid queuing for the rides unless you want to buy the priority ticket. I think the priority ticket is $40 extra. Go on all the big attractions first and then walk around the park later. The food inside is pricey but it is nice. There is lockers at most of the attractions where you can store your bags for free for 45 minutes. The only locker you have to pay for is the Jurassic park water one. The comedy shows inside are decent as well and really suit a younger audience.,Universal Studios Singapore
Rinkal J,5.0,"December 10, 2018",Most attractive place for all at Singapore,"There was heavy Rush at Universal studios all the time and specially on Saturdays & Sundays. It's a big place and covers many excited things. In full day also you can't cover all the things. so just reach at sharp 9.30 am. Its closes at 6.00 pm. And if there is rain that some rides and shows might not be working.  At the entrance of the universal studio, you will get brochure... explains about the map of the different city, shows timings etc. So first go through it, plan out the things you like and want to do as per your choice. Many shows are happens only for 2 times in a day.  If you are ride lovers then better to take express pass so can go directly without waiting your time in precious queue. There will be very less queue for single. If you go in single line then your turn will be in 5-10 minutes instead of 40-60 mnt queue.  MUST DO AT UNIVERSAL STUDIOS: 1) Transformer 2) Human & cylon (Roller coaster -Two types) 3) Mummy (At East Egypt) 4) Water world 5) light, camera action  If you have a kid then visit FAR FAR WAY there..... kids will enjoy there. My son enjoyed at Enchanted airways. it's small roller coaster for kids.  create memories at Universal",Universal Studios Singapore
Anamul Hoque,5.0,"December 9, 2018",Pure Entertainment,It's simply a different world. The rides are beyond description. But you have to go through a long que if you don't buy the express entry.

mujergato,4.0,"December 9, 2018",Making unforgettable memories,"My kiddo turned 5 and I wanted him to experience the highs and lows of theme parks. We had a freaking great time and he Can t wait to go back!  Pros - So clean, seriously never been to a big park that was this clean - Lay out pretty easy, the map can help but we didn't need it, pretty easy to get around - Express pass worth every penny, we didn't want all day and had front seat for the majority of rides - Food, drinks and souvenirs actually affordable -3d virtual rides were fantastic, we both loved Transformers and Shrek, worth going on! - Puss n Boots was his favorite, so much going besides a ride, he loved the story telling  Cons - Great the unlimited express pass as the one time only becomes a problem if your child doesn't meet height requirements. They should just go to a different system like if there are 10 rides, give us a card with 10 circles that get marked off. My kid wanted to ride Puss n Boots several times but couldn't ride the big dollar coaster or Battle star ride. -Madagascar ride closed and being they only have a handful of kids rides, just sucked - Not all rides are included in express ride pass",Universal Studios Singapore
newycouple,3.0,"December 9, 2018",Singapore visit,My husband and I visited universal studios while spending time at Sentosa Idland. I’m sure if you had children or teenagers it would be a great day however as a mid 50 couple we were bored! Apart from the rides that if they were a decent ride had a 1hr wait time there wasn’t much else to do... plenty of souvenir shops and food stalls. By the way you are unable to take your own food or water through the gates. We have see it now but won’t go back for a second look.,Universal Studios Singapore

carleen_0986,5.0,"December 6, 2018",For the Kids and Kids at Heart,"It's my first thanksgiving holiday and Singapore was the first place came to mind. My friends and I wanted to spend it somewhere we can really enjoy. In Universal Studios Singapore you have to be a child and feel like a child to enjoy. We tried all the rides there is. Since we are early the lines are not yet too long so be sure to go as early as 9:30 since it opens at 10 am and closes at 6pm. I'm not sure why they close early this season. We went directly to Transformers: The Ride because this is the most famous attraction and typically you will wait more than an hour so we don't really want to pass this one out. Other rides like the Battleship galactica Human vs Cylon are really fun to ride. Waiting time was about 30mins. It's good that they put up a sign on how long you might be waiting in line. Some of our friends don't really enjoy extreme rides, so since its only the two of us who wanted to try all of them we ask the attendants for single rider pass. It gets you to skip the loooong line but the catch is that you are not going to be with your friend. Anyway it's fine you'll get to know a new one on each ride. And if your lucky, you may just find your soulmate. 😂 just kidding. But yeah, try the single entry pass this way you may try all the rides without waiting. I hate waiting. For each ride, you just have to approach the attendants on each ride and there are some where there is a special line designated to single entries. By the way, there is a downside, it rained around 4pm and we stayed at the treasure hunt ride, when the rain stopped it took us 30mins and still they didn't restart the ride. They are not allowing people to enter as well but they just let us wait there in vain. They were not even testing the machine and not even telling us that they will not open again. It really pissed me off. They should have told earlier that they would no longer open so we would not have spend another 30mins just to wait for them to operate. I really hate waiting especially if its in vain!  That was it. Weather is unpredictable so remember to bring an umbrella. Enjoy your Universe!",Universal Studios Singapore
Renuka Garg,5.0,"December 6, 2018",A fun filled action packed adventure,"I will not describe in detail the rides or themes available in Universal Studios Singapore but list out a few important points - Spend at least the whole day or two days, if you really wish to enjoy all rides without getting a sense of repetition. - Buy the tickets beforehand and express pass, if you wish to avoid queues. - Don't carry huge bags as you will have to deposit them in lockers at many rides. - Arrive by 9 am or a little before. - Take the rides in no particular sequence, depending upon the wait time which is displayed outside each area. - You may wish to take the Human-Cylon and Revenge of the Mummy rides on a relatively empty stomach. - Intersperse rides with the 4D shows to maintain the novelty of each ride - the one of a tornado in New York you shouldn't miss. The live show in the water world is a must see if you enjoy stunts and lots of water. - Carry a poncho or a change of your top/tee as you will get wet in the Jurassic park ride. - Do visit the souvenir shops even if you don't wish to buy stuff since the collections are very unique and interesting.",Universal Studios Singapore
Cim,4.0,"December 6, 2018",Fun tiring day,Accessible thru Sentosa Express Gets crowded on a weekend so you have to wait in line for 30 mins before you could enjoy a ride but totally worth it if it's Galactica. Adding more light around the park would be nice.,Universal Studios Singapore
stevemNewcastle,4.0,"December 5, 2018",Great day out,"Sentosa is easy to get to by public transport. Take the MRT to the Harbourfront stop and you arrive in Vivocity shopping mall. Take the elevators to Level 3, buy your tickets for Sentosa Express at the machines or desk, on the train then first stop in about 4 minutes for Universal which is a two minute walk from the station. The park is well laid out and though smaller than the US one's still has plenty to do",Universal Studios Singapore
Christine J,5.0,"December 5, 2018",nice day out,"Universal is only small but there is so much to do at Sentosa, we went on tour of the war, the beaches are small but lovely and lots of really nice restaurants and bars and os much more other activities for a full day out",Universal Studios Singapore
twisterella6,3.0,"December 5, 2018",Nice day out,"This park isn’t massive and doesn’t have a huge amount of rides but it does make for a great day out. What is there is well maintained and entertaining. The Transformers ride is unbelievable and worth waiting in line for, as is the Jurassic Park Rapids Adventure (warning: you will get wet on this one). I would suggest spending the extra money on an express pass as it gets very hot and waiting in line can get uncomfortable and tiring. Also quite a few of the rides are quite short so waiting for 40 minutes for a 1 minute ride can be annoying. We found the food options to be limited so it’s a good idea to get a pass out and eat outside of the park. This also gives you an opportunity to get out of the heat and have a quick break. Again I stress that it gets really hot, so be prepared. Dress appropriately and carry water with you.",Universal Studios Singapore
marklh2014,4.0,"December 4, 2018",Universal fun,"Had a great day at Universal I recommend the fast pass purchase as you enter.

Nonetheless, my kids love many attractions there. Their favourites are transformers, water world, Jurassic park, and Shrek. With Express pass, we can go through the park in 2 to 3 hours. Otherwise, wait often would be too long, especially for small kids.  Food is available throughout the park, but mostly are unhealthy fried or sweet items. We usually go outside the park to eat lunch. Our favourite is Chilis close by front gate.",Universal Studios Singapore
Natalie W,5.0,"December 3, 2018",Express pass!! Do it!!,Spent the whole day at universal studios and we think we visited majority of the attractions.

Whats worst was the fact that my wife lost her purse. We panicked and asked where was the lost and found from one of the shop. The storekeeper just directed me to the entrance but when I got to the entrance, everyone was exiting. I asked the people in red where was lost and found and pointed at the direction. But there was a long queue.  My wife walked and a lady in blue saw her and asked her what was wrong. she told her that she lost her purse. to my surprise, i saw her walk with m wife back to shreks home. and we walked all around the area and found my wifes purse in the comfort room. it was a relief because our IDs were there.  She told us not to worry and made us feel secure. might seem like a simple thing, but it has been 2 months since and i just want to take this time to thank her. I asked for her name and she told it was a country and katherine in front, so if we wanted to come back we could look for her. her name is katherine france and we want to thank universal studious for having the sincerest people work in a theme park. and thank you to her.",Universal Studios Singapore

It's photogenic but it's crowded and somewhat costly for eatable items...  Tips to Save money & Time - 1) Choose weekdays so it will be less crowed and you can avoid express pass expensive ticket. 2) Carry water bottle with you... it's hot outside and water inside is costly (it goes upto 6$ in some counter) but they have many water points same like airport wherein you can refill your bottle... (*** Tap water safe in Singapore) 3) Start in opposite direction... most tour guide inform you not to miss transformer... roller coaster ride and these come on the way when you enter and during start of day its big queue, instead if you start from behind there is less or no crowd on ride. 4) You have option to go out (Don't forget to carry your ticket) of park by putting stamp on your hand. So go out have lunch outside compare to less crowed and less costly food counter and comeback fast for next ride. 5) Explore Internet booking website and they offer you discounted tickets.  Rides not to miss Transformer, mummy ride , Madagascar... Shows not to miss are - 4D Show, Waterworld",Universal Studios Singapore
2030231252,5.0,"November 27, 2018",Beyond satisfy,"I stayed in Festival hotel, 1D USS ticket from other promotion. When I walk into USS entrance, I realize that Monday was full of group tourism, I've no choice to queue for express pass. Turns out i made the right choice. 2 adults & 3 kids have make the most joy of the day. So here are some tips: - if it isn't long queue, dont waste of used up your 1 time express pass - the park entry time is from 9am-7pm, there should be enough time to take a 30mins queue ride. - i back to Festival hotel to let my kids rest a bit, shower, & sleep (4yo kid), we back into USS again at 4:45pm still able to finish of the joyful ride, 4D shows, etc (except cyclone & Jurassic non-express ride). - we took consecutive 3 rounds of transformer ride at 6:35pm (until i almost threw up) as there were less than 10 peeps queuing. - I took 2pm lunch break inside USS, & dinner at 8pm at outside USS after firework, it cost like $10-15/portion with kinda large at the Asian Cuisine area.  in conclusion, the trip is a lil higher cost than I budgeted, but what matter is FUN. I'd rather make the most in 1 trip than revisit the same place to do what didn't.",Universal Studios Singapore
Grantw1964,4.0,"November 27, 2018",Great way to spend the day,Catch the cable car to Sentosa Island and enjoy a great day at Universal Studios. Just be aware there are a lot of roller coasters and you need to hire a locker.,Universal Studios Singapore
Hanalei,4.0,"November 27, 2018",A perfect weekend escape,"Universal Studios is a great destination to have your weekend escape from the chaotic reality of our lives. Universal Studios Singapore offers enjoyable rides, neatly placed in a just-right sized area of Sentosa Island. The palm trees and the slight tropical breeze makes you feel as though you are commencing an adventure, a different feel from shopping at Orchard Road or reading articles on your phone in Starbucks. I have been there five times before, and I found that purchasing the express pass will help you get through the park in an effective way. We all want to spend our weekends in a meaningful and energized way. Why not spend it in Universal Studios?",Universal Studios Singapore
Manoj_Nitu,4.0,"November 26, 2018",Good fun,all the rides are good. We purchased express pass then only it took as whole day to complete.  Specially Transformer and the mummy rides are awesome.  Only dissapointment is food.very expensive and not much vegetarian options.,Universal Studios Singapore
Anika,4.0,"November 26, 2018",Express pass is preferable if one wants to cover entire place in a day.,"The most important tip is to reach as early as possible. We reached around noon and missed many activities. Jurassic Park ride was fun. Some ride may require you to store your stuff in the lockers .Lockers may or may not be free depending on the area. Long waiting time ,almost 30 minutes on average for most of the rides so either be prepared or buy express pass which can be used on most rides.",Universal Studios Singapore
Jay H,5.0,"November 26, 2018",Well worth a visit!,"Highly recommend visiting if you are in Singapore. After doing Universal Orlando 20+ times and Universal Studios Hollywood earlier this year, we didn’t know what to expect but were impressed. It’s nowhere near as big or and doesn’t have as many rides, but it meant it was manageable in 1 day. Some of the rides are exactly the same although they do have their unique ones too not found in any of the US Universal parks. We visited during rainy season but it didn’t matter as most of the walkways / streets / queues were well covered and prepared for the weather.  Common rides with other Universal Studios: The Mummy (indoor roller-coaster), Shrek 4D & Transformers. Jurassic park rides were also similar.",Universal Studios Singapore
Cstar88,5.0,"November 26, 2018",Nice and wonderful spending a day tour here,"Several rides designed for kids as well as there are rides for adults. It is advised to spend a day tour in USS, and there are free lockers provided in the park. You may spend your lunch in the park else may go out from the park and enter again.  Average waiting hour could be 60 to 90 minutes per ride. Bring your poncho in case you have the intention to ride the Jurassic park floating boat which may get wet.  Also, the 1pm show is a must to watch so arrange your time nicely.",Universal Studios Singapore

Gershon V,3.0,"November 25, 2018",Fun day out with a limited selection of rides,"The park was great and the Transformers ride was great but besides the major roller-coasters, there weren't too many more rides that captured your imagination.

mangoes1977,1.0,"November 24, 2018",Very unpleasant,"Each ride took a minimum of 30 mins waiting. Heaps of rides were closed due to 'bad weather' as told by the staff but we weren't convinced as it was bright and sunny! Staff were very rude,not helpful and not a smile on a single staff's face from entrance to the eatery place. First and last visit for sure. I would rather spend a bit of money crossing the border to go to Legoland Malaysia. It's a much happier experience there with helpful and cheerful staff!",Universal Studios Singapore

Ginder_12,4.0,"November 23, 2018",Get the Utimate Express!,"We arrived at Universal Studiosd before 10am ( we took a taxi from our Hotel -I had pre-booked Universal Studios before we arrived in Singapore. It was easy. We paid the extra $50/ticket for the Ultimate Express Pass. We had printed out the tickets at home ( I would suggest just have them on your mobile phone- would have been easy too) We waited in line. There were long lines. But, when it was time to open, the lines moved fairly quickly. They didn't need passports, they just scanned the barcodes and let us through. We went to Guest Services to the left of the entrance and arranged our Ultimate Express Pass. We were given a wrist band to wear which made things easy for us. They didn't ask to see any ID- just scanned the barcode of the Express ticket. I had written down which rides to do first and what to see, but, my teenager wanted to circle the park in order, so my plans went out the window. Don't listen to your teenager if you don't have the Ultimate Express Pass!! We got on to most rides without a wait. it was wonderful!! The lines could be very very long but because of the pass we would go to the head of a separate line and be incorporated into the lines, so you may only have a very short wait or none at all. There were a couple of rides we couldn't use the pass for and the was the Canopy Flyer- we ended up having to wait about 20 minutes and we hated it. It was a fun flight - I would have liked to do that one a few times. Also the Treasure Hunt one for kids. We didn't manage to do that one. We loved the transformers ride, the Jurassic Park ride( did that 4 times) We had to pay for lockers for that ride $4 for 1 hour as we had backpacks, etc. We had a poncho which came in handy to keep shoes dry, as I forgot to change into thongs ( your feet usually get wet) Shrek 4D was a must see. Really enjoyable. Loved the Battle star Galactica roller coaster-screamed so much because I was really frightened. My teenager thought it was fun and laughed as I screamed. Teenager loved the Cylon suspended Roller coaster. No way was I getting on that! Skipped the Revenge of the Mummy Ride Watched ""Water World"" Excellent show. The weather was hot and humid. There were water fountains around the park. there are drink sellers everywhere. Lots of places to buy souvenirs. As you exit every ride you walk through a souvenir shop. Ate at Starbots in Sci-fi World about 2 pm. It was still very busy but we managed to get a table. The food was nice and reasonable for a theme park. We refilled our water bottles at the fountains. You can buy a poncho for $5SGD at the park if you need one. Wear good walking shoes. Bring thongs for the Jurassic Park Rapids ride if you are wearing shoes that you don't want to get wet. Some lockers for rides were free (not Jurassic Park, though) for a certain amount of time depending on how long the wait was for a ride. Bring snacks and your own water bottle to fill up. I brought a small towel to wet in case it was too hot, but, it was fine. Bring a hat. Wear loose cotton clothing in the humid weather. Really enjoyable day. We left about 5:30pm. There are shops and eateries outside Universal studios. We visited Candylicious to buy some lollies. Very expensive mostly and the lines at that time were long and slow.",Universal Studios Singapore
Chan Jing Jie,4.0,"November 23, 2018",A day of fun and adventure!,"This theme park is easily one of the best around the world, with a wide variety of rides and attractions. Personally my favourite is the Mummy. Even for the faint-hearted, there are many mild rides that can be taken. For the thrill-seekers, do not miss out the Battlestar Galatica: Human vs. Cylon! It is really a ride NOT TO MISS!!!",Universal Studios Singapore

Nay Kapitzke,5.0,"November 22, 2018",A place for even the big kids,"I cannot recommend this theme park high enough. It is extremely clean, the staff are informative and polite, the attractions are plentiful and I haven’t had as much fun as I did that day, in years! Personal favourite rides were; 1: Transformers 2: The Mummy 3: Puss In Boots 4: Canopy flyer / Jurassic Park Section of the Park  Tips for when visiting the park:  1: If you can, don’t visit in school holidays as there was already really long rides and we missed out on going on the two large roller coasters due to waiting times 2: Buy the express pass, no matter the season.. we would have been able to see the shows and go on all the rides, if we just bought the pass 3: Some rides you will have to put your belongings in the lockers so try and either visit these rides first or buy stuff towards the end of the day.. as if you go crazy as the gift shops like what we did, you won’t have room to put your bag and gift shop bags in 4: If it’s raining wear comfortable thongs / waterproof shoes, unless you are comfortable running around the park all day with wet feet. I wore thongs, but my partner wore sneakers and had blisters and wet feet all day.  If you visit Singapore, you MUST visit Universal Studios!!",Universal Studios Singapore
Nia,4.0,"November 22, 2018",Good variety of halal food,Halal food is very easy to find.Just look out for the halal certificate inside the restaurant which is green and white in colour.There is also a prayer room for muslims near the Battlestar Gallactica ride.

Louise A,3.0,"November 21, 2018",Day out,If you haven't already been to Universal Studios in LA then you will enjoy Sentosa Islands version. It was a monday when we went so not as busy as a weekend visit. If it had been a weekend then it would have been worth buy the ticket that allows you to go to the front of the queue and not wait in the long lines.There is a clock at the beginning of each ride that tells you how long the wait will be. We always waited less than they would say. Most of the rides will take photos of you but they are quite pricey. It is a lot smaller than the LA studios but we had a great day,Universal Studios Singapore
omeire,2.0,"November 21, 2018","Small theme park , Not worth the ticket price","The theme park is quite small , find that most of the rides are getting old and tired . Need a refresher . Not much , can cover the whole park in 2 hours provided the queues r not too long . Not suitable for kids under 4 . Not much rides they can take . Express queue pass is recommended during peak period , for the dinning in USS , lunch time is pretty crowded, best to go during off peak . Not really worth it to pay so much for a small theme park .",Universal Studios Singapore
Clarissa I,2.0,"November 21, 2018","Not well maintained, not suitable for young kids , overall not worth the price of the tickets","We have visited the park in the past and now we visited with our family of 4 young kids ; we are pretty disappointed by the overall experience over in USS , there isn’t much rides to start with , and many of the rides are not well maintained, on top of that , we notice that certain rides have certain features deactivated, for example at the Jurassic Park , the Rapid ride , we are anticipating the T-rex roaring at the end but all we saw in the darkness is a T-Rex that is deactivated or spolit . Over at the madagascar boat ride the water curtain at the end is also missing , over at shrek castle 4D show , some of the seats are not really moving ... the staffs there are mostly unmotivatedand , look bored , some of them are nice though. My 2 younger kids who are 2.5 and 6 yr old took less than 3 rides , they don’t really enjoy much ; there is alot of queuing at the more popular rides, and can be take almost 1-2 hours sometimes . Advisable to get priority queue pass during peak period. We spend almost $300 sgd for the tickets for our family but totally not worth it imo.",Universal Studios Singapore
ozzytraveller,4.0,"November 20, 2018",worth a visit,"We visited in November, on a Wednesday. It was not all that busy so we did not buy a jump the queue ticket. Actually I felt a bit sorry for those who did as they zoomed past us in the fast queue then entered the shows and rides at almost the same time as we did. I would wait and see how busy it is before spending the money. Some of the rides need a bit of refurbishment, they are older and a bit tired but fun for people with little kids still. Age is catching up with them though and if the park is to survive they need to have a look at this. We are not roller coaster people so by-passed those, they did look amazing though. The 3D, 4D etc shows were awesome and well worth going on, even old farts can cope with then, though they can be a bit jolting (Transformers), if you are in reasonable health and joints are OK still then give it a go. We spent 5 hours at the park and covered what we wanted to see.",Universal Studios Singapore

The waterworld show was closed due to rains ... two of the other shows , donkey and oscar the grouch (started on that day itself) were closed mid show due to some technical issues.... all in all a fun day out for the entire family.",Universal Studios Singapore

Rides to definitely take if you are a rollercoaster junkie, battlestar galactica (human and cylon), the mummy ride, transformers ride.

Mumtravels86,4.0,"November 19, 2018",Worth a visit!,"We went yesterday (Monday) and bought the express pass ($40 extra each) which made all of the difference I think. We were always first in the que with priority access and no waiting time’s. Food and the shops are pretty expensive, but that was to be expected. Our lunch was pretty crappy actually - nachos is apparently a bag of chips and a box of melted cheese. And I’ll also include a photo of the “hotdog and chips” 🤔.

Megan F,5.0,"November 19, 2018","Small, easy to get around and do all the attractions",We went 14th September 2018 and went at opening time. We bought our tickets there and didn't wait too long. It is not too big and easy to get around. We were able to go on the rides a few times each. We did buy the Express Pass and used them but the lines were not too bad if you don't have the budget for it. We really only bought drinks as it was too hot too eat.,Universal Studios Singapore

Its smaller than some other theme parks and we got round it comfortably in 6 hours. Express tickets are a must! We waited 2-5 minutes for most rides versus 25-45 minutes in the normal queue. There were a few 'must' do rides for adults (mummy's return and Battlestar were 2 crackers!). Atmosphere was fantastic but the place is geared up to part you from your money - $6 for water!

USA shows are updated seasonal and so should the Singapore outfit. We were lucky to have express passes so getting on rides were a breeze so that’s highly recommended. Food and beverage for the quality is crazily overpriced. On the day we went, we did not know that the parked was too be closed early for a private event and while we had planned to go back in the evening for more rides and fireworks, we missed out and was rather disappointed.  Won’t be back anytime soon unless there are refreshed rides, shows and attractions.",Universal Studios Singapore
sanjaymehta503,4.0,"November 17, 2018",Full of adventure,Very interseting place particularly for youngsters.

David H,1.0,"November 16, 2018",Big queues,"Weekday and the wait time was massive. Rides would say 35 minuets however 90 minuets later you were still 20 minuets from the ride. A lot of wasted time waiting and kids getting bored not to mention when/if they went to the toilet you go to the back of the line( can’t go back to you spot you were in and have to line up again) (they don’t want to know about it either) Preference giving to express ticket holders and groups of single riders who while in line were together, however they all get on within 5 to 10 minuets while all others are waiting for 1.5+ hours. In all the LA universal BY FAR exceeds Singapore’s attraction however the kids enjoyed it. Fill the wallet as always with these places and if you do go, pay for the express pass. You won’t regret it. Overall I would not go again and would not recommend it to anyone. There are far more attractions in Singapore to see and do.

LisaWellOz,2.0,"November 13, 2018",time and money wasting,"We bought tickets in advance to save time, well, but it still took us about 30min to enter. Moreover, we stood in line for approx 45min-1hour for each ride we wanted to take, I couldn't breath among such crowd sometimes. Besides, the attitude of USS staff were so bad, we asked them in polite way but some even didn't reply us, they just shaked their heads. Before taking one ride, we were required to leave our belongings in the locker, yes, we did and paid for it for a certain amount of time as regulated, after 1 hour queuing and 1min taking the ride, we returned to get our stuff but couldn't open it. Their staff explain that it happended because it was over time, then we had to pay for extra fee. The point is we and many other people had to keep following 2 staff, asking them again and again to get our money and open the locker. OMG. What a service! I saw many other with skip-the-line tickets queue for 20-30min for some rides too. Some games were fun but in general we got exhausted and had bad experience. In fact, they can control the number of visitors by selling limited tickets, but I bet they don't, they just sell as many as they can. Btw, food and drinks were so so but a little expensive. The last thing we did at USS and found it only-one good thing on that day was watching waterworld show, so exciting!. There are some other more interesting places to see in Singapore rather than USS.",Universal Studios Singapore
Chi S,5.0,"November 12, 2018",Still worth the money,It was my fourth time to visit in the past 6 years and I gotta say it’s still worth the money. And in all those trips I still haven’t explored everything in this themepark. Yes it is that big so it can really get tiring to visit everything in here. The characters don’t always show up. I guess they only do that on weekends and holidays. There are a lot of kiosks/stores and a number of restaurants so food isnt a problem here. Toilets are also scattered. Overall experience was tiring but really fun and I’m very sure to go again next time I visit Singapore.,Universal Studios Singapore
Kunal Gol,4.0,"November 12, 2018",Re: Fun visit.,"Make sure it's not going to rain during your visit, as exciting rides go out of performance during rains. As well the if it's too crowded then it's preferable to buy express pass which helps you skip the queue, the pricing though is speculative of demand. We went on Halloween so the evening parade was cancelled as well due to halloween parade which instead was a paid activity for which you would require to buy an extra ticket.",Universal Studios Singapore
Kirsten H,5.0,"November 11, 2018",Awesome day out,"We arrived as soon as the gates opened which meant we were able to go on most of the rides before the crowds started.

It was a great family day out and the only reason we left early was due to rain!",Universal Studios Singapore

adikeshavan,3.0,"November 11, 2018",Wrong time.... Wrong company... Awesome place...Must go place in your lifetime,"Despite being a weekday, the crowd is too much. Minimum wait time was ranging from 60 min to 90 min for every ride. Universal studio can be classified into 2 parts for better planning one section for kids and another for thrill seeker adults and grown up kids, and trust me you can cover only one of them in a day, and with the crowd i witnessed, i think i couldn't have had covered even one part.Make sense to take priority pass( must be some premium over standard ticket) worth every penny, direct access to every event.Make sure your at the studio by sharp 10 am , since the rides will start closing from 5 onwards, you have practically 6 hr, considering you have 1 hr for lunch. Website sugest no food allowed, however i saw people carrrying food , since the food is expensive in the studio, water is availabe, carry empty bottles. Stroller will cost you 15 SGD, it s worth, since we will have to travel alot within studio.One of the atttractions for kids are the photo session with the cartoon characters like Minions, Madagascar characters , Piinochioo etc... buy the package of 60 USD, get the soft copy of all the pic you take, it a nice way to capture the moments and trust me kids loves it... My experience was mediocore, since the we wanted to do everthing, but could do hardly any thing. However follw above suggestions to make your experience better. Must go for all in your lifetime",Universal Studios Singapore
akl76,3.0,"November 10, 2018",Only few rides worth.,"Like all class theme park this is just one of it. On map it looks 'big' , its not so. Only a few of the attractions/rides are worth for adults. The place is nice for instragramers!. The transformer ride was worth it, but we que 60 mins for it at noon. Than almost an hour before park closing time, there was no que. We could go in for three more times!. Than this boat ride, same we had to que for another 60 ++mins. I cant say if anyone should just go for the lesser waiting time atractions first or go streight for the best awsome rides/atractios first, just dont miss the best ones - handfull only. I dont think its worth visiting second time for all it has to offer as the ticket is expensive. Furthermore, the park operational hour is 10 to 6 and i doubt any one could cover seeing or experiencing 80% of wht has to offer. And definately not going back to see the rest i missed. Neverthelesd is a nice colorfull place to spend with family.",Universal Studios Singapore

Happiness23159191431,3.0,"November 9, 2018",First Impression lasts,"Disneyland is a dream come true to me as well as this famous universal studio in SG. We we're so excited to see if it will meet our expectation like the Disneyland HK. Before that, just a piece of advice when using booking.com. We thought there'll be no hassle moment for us in purchasing Universal Studio tickets because when we booked our hotel choice thru booking.com, the website emailed us a confirmation that we successfully booked our hotel online and that a QRcode is included as our VIP pass for the 63 SG attractions we'd like to visit and they will just process the payments using our credit card being used in our hotel transaction. Sad to say, at the ticket booth in the Universal Studio, I was showing them the QR code from booking.com and said I will use it. But the officer said they are Not Partners so they didn't accept it.:( Good thing I have SG dollars with me to purchase a ticket. Anyway, what I really want to tackle based on our experience and personal opinion (and when you travel with your kids)is that Disneyland is better than Universal Studios. Why? Because Disneyland offers more enjoyable rides for kids plus a beautiful parade in the afternoon and a magnificent parade in the evening plus the astounding fireworks! In the Universal Studios there's no parade especially when it rains. And when it rains, they cancel rides operations for the safety of people. So better check the weather before going there. But what we like is the transformer ride, lights camera action, and the live concert of donkey. It's good also to dine at Goldilocks inside the theme park because they offer kiddie meal with free souvenir. :)",Universal Studios Singapore
sonyteju,4.0,"November 9, 2018",Universal Studios Singapore - Worth it but without the wait,"We ( 2A +2C) planned for a one day visit to USS. After all the hype and eagerness we landed there at 10 AM just when it opened and there was already a huge crowd ( this was 2 days before Diwali). Here are the some insights.  1 Get a online map of USS before you even land up in Singapore and decide on what all are the must do rides 2. If you want to experience all the events and attractions at the place in 1 day , get an express pass - Its worth it , will save a tonne of time 3. If you have small children travelling with you, there are some rides where they are not allowed (think its below 1.3 Mtrs) , so plan accordingly 4. They display the wait time for most rides , if its more than 40 mins , dont wait , finish other things and try again. We landed there and headed straight for the transformers show , waited for 1.45 hrs , in the afternoon the wait time was more like 30 mins .The show was though really good 5. Don`t waste time and money on Caricature , tattoos and photo artists , very expensive and not worth it, you could do this elsewhere too  Hope this insights are useful",Universal Studios Singapore

Management,3.0,"November 8, 2018",Disappointing visit,"We have visited Universal Studios in Singapore. In preparation, we bought the tickets including the express entry online and paid a total of USD 212.-- (which included USD 60.-- for Express entry).  Once being there, the cable car was sold to us at 70 S$ without asking or clarifying, that there are 4 trips per head. We overpaid 2 trips each as we were not aware, that we also paid for the second cable car.  When in the park, many of the attractions were not offering Express Entry, other attractions still had waiting time of 30 minutes with the Express Entry.  The park itself is nice, not too overcrowded but the fact, that we have overpaid a lot without many benefits ruined my day.  Overall very disappointing for us. 😤",Universal Studios Singapore
ManjunathSV,4.0,"November 8, 2018",Lots of fun and thrills,"Reach early to enjoy maximum rides. Use free maps available at counters for easy movement. Some shows have limited timings. pl check beforehand if you desire not to miss them. Lockers are free to use upto 45 mins. beyond which a nominal charge is levied. They are useful in case of thrill rides and Jurassic Park Rapids Adventure. Not to miss 4D attractions like Transformers, Shrek. Water world is definitely worth a visit.",Universal Studios Singapore

sameervasisht,5.0,"November 8, 2018",great outing for all,"a great outing. specially if you are with kids or love rides and want to have fun. certain pointers 1. try and visit on a weekday and not on a weekend. 2. if its not holiday season, you can finish it in one day easily. 3. take express card. it will help, even if its less rush.its worth the money. it reduces the wait time drastically. 4. carry something to cover yourself from water. there are 1-2 areas where you may get wet. 5. use lockers to keep stuff when going on rides. its free for certain duration. 6. arrive early. buy tickets in advance. try and get a combo to save money. 7. enter and go to avenger ride straight ways. it has the biggest line. 8. take human and cyclone ride if you like thrill. 9. note time of shows, and be there well in time. if you have express card, it willl save you time here also. 10. waterworld show is very nice. must see. 11. talking donkey show can be missed. 12. carry reusable bottles, enough places to refill you water bottle inside.",Universal Studios Singapore

Lack of staff ? Or what ? After Queuing for 40 mins on both rides there was an announcement that some interruption has occurred and we were advised to leave the Queues on both rides waiting time is 60 mins now undetermined time . What a waste of our money and time as they also announced the the park will close at 6 instead of normal time . Weather is good and no sign of thunderstorms or bad weather. Spoiled experience for the days I guess. Typical poor maintenance and service probably. Very disappointed poor service . Feel ripped off!,Universal Studios Singapore

They recognise overseas Seniors cards so it cost us $76 per couple. Great value for a whole day’s fun. We didn’t go on any of the rides obviously but there were plenty to be had- we went on a Saturday so it was a fairly busy day. We went to see the Shrek show in 4D, the wonderful Waterworld show and the Spielberg show( where they take you to see how part of a movie is made). Loads of other attractions to see and lots of things to do. Well worth the visit",Universal Studios Singapore

We specially likes the couple of water rides, wtaerworld show, coupe of stage shows You need to plan your day as some events have fixed timings. If you plan you can cover all that you are interested in. Also everything you buy inside is insanely costly. I paid 13 sgd for 2 water bottles . Depending on the crowd ypu can buy the express passes which are available in many shops. That reduced our waiting time for the rides from 30 mins to 5 mins and was big convenience. However i felt the universal studio in LA was better. It had some extra attractions. Nevertheless this is still worth one day trip.",Universal Studios Singapore

My grand-daughter loved the rides she went on, she missed a few of the wild rides as she is too young. Some of the rides had very long waiting time, the wilder the ride the longer the wait. My comments about the rides are limited as I am unable to manage anything that gores around in circles (including the merry-go-round), so I cannot comment too much. But the others did enjoy themselves - they did appreciate having someone to mind the bags!!  Two things stand out about USS: 1. The cleanliness - absolutely no rubbish anywhere! 2. Safety - in the hours we spent in the park I did not see a single security person. At no tile did I worry about safety.",Universal Studios Singapore

Matt,1.0,"November 5, 2018",Not worth the Time or Money,"Having never visited any Universal Studio I was looking forward to my first in Singapore but was terribly let down. I hope they are not all like this.  We got in reasonably early at 1030 and the queues for the rides were already in excess of 60 mins. For a location that is only open for 8 hours that is giving you a maximum of 8 rides for your visit. It only got worse we opted for the Transformers ride which was showing a 70 min wait...at least you’re warned only problem was we queued for over 2hrs for a ride that goes for 4 mins. Ride was a good experience but not worth the wait. By the time we finished the ride the average published queue times on the other rides was 90mins.  You can purchase a priority queue ticket for $40 SGD once inside Universal Studios which allows you to at least half your queue time. I would suggest this is the only way to potentially get the most out of your day otherwise you will spend your entire day in queues.  As expected for a theme park the food prices where on the very high end. $20 SGD for a average burger, chips and drink.  On the positive the Waterworld action show is worth going to. The actors & actress are entertaining and the plane at the end is the highlight!  For a theme park I would definitely suggest this parks theme was ‘Waiting’. There are much better ways to spend your time and money in Singapore.",Universal Studios Singapore
Kate A,1.0,"November 5, 2018",Disappointment,"Admittedly, I hate wandering crowds that have no idea where they are walking, and my teen son hates over stimulation from too many visuals and loud noise all at once. We own these factors came into play in our judgement, but it was clearly nothing more than over priced items for sale, copious fried food cafes in each section and queues for rides about 70 min each.  We both hated being there, so did one lap, waited in 2 queues for 20 min each, but gave up as there seemed to be technical difficulties with both, pushing the queues even further out.  We found our way to Fort Siloso and had a substantially better time.  On the plus side, watching families wander around in matching t shirts was wonderful!",Universal Studios Singapore

smags2015,2.0,"November 4, 2018",Waste of money,Went to universal studios while staying on Sentosa island. Got there early as we wanted to see as much as we could before it got too hot and avoid the crowds. Turned out it didn’t make a difference. To me it wasn’t worth the money unless you paid the extra $40 each per person to have a priority pass to get on the rides. And that’s only to go on it once. I think it was and extra $70 if you wanted to go on them more than once. We went on two rides one we waited 20 mins or so the other 30 mins . Then you just couldn’t get on any unless you waited over 70mins for each ride. Everything again very expensive. To get photos with any characters a big wait line then they say no more. Wouldn’t go there again.,Universal Studios Singapore

It's excellent. The rides were a lot of fun. It wasn't a busy day when we were there so the express pass wasn't necessary but I'd definitely recommend it if it's busy. We found it quite easy to purchase tickets at the entry. There were plenty of places to buy snacks and lunch and lots of cover if it rains. We had a great day. The Transformers ride was the best in our opinion but they were all good depending on the age group. Our grand children are 7 and 11 and loved it.,Universal Studios Singapore

We used our membership with express, and writhing 50 min did 4 big rides (transformers, cylon, Jurassic park and the dragon coaster) The rides were great, queues short (end of the day) and we had no issues. As someone that has been visiting the park regularly since It opened, the only place I see that it has gone down in quality is staff engagement. No one goes the extra mile to welcome, smile, thank or engage guests in the theme/ atmosphere of the park. When they first opened (years ago) the remaining staff would all come down to Main Street at the end of the day to wave guests good bye and cheer.

Don’t try to bring food and drinks inside the park coz they going to check your bag before you enter. There’s a lot of restaurants inside USS so you don’t have to worry.

jodie_amanda,5.0,"October 31, 2018",Great day out for the whole family,"Myself, my husband, and our two daughters, aged 4 & 2 recently enjoyed a day out at Universal Studios, Singapore. Children aged 3 and under are free to enter. We chose to go on a Monday as weekdays are a lot quieter than weekends. Wait times were reasonable at only 10-15 minutes per ride. We hired a double stroller on entry for $20, which was invaluable considering that it is a large park and little legs tend to get sore with all of the walking required. For families with young children it is best to turn left after entering the first section as the rides that cater for younger children are located in that direction. Our girls loved the rides. My 4 year old loved the Shrek 4D show and live shows, and my 2 year old loved meeting the different characters around the park. They also loved seeing Donkey Live!, where two children are picked out of the audience to talk to Donkey from Shrek. We sat in the middle of the first long row, and our 4 year old was one of the two children chosen, which was a lot of fun. There are of course height restrictions for different rides, and if like us you have a tall child (over 94cm) and under 4 years of age, they will get in free and get to enjoy a lot of the rides. When you visit Universal Studios be prepared for a full day. We spent 9 hours there, and will definitely visit again before we leave Singapore.",Universal Studios Singapore

isle&arc,5.0,"October 29, 2018",A good scare for Halloween.,"Truth be-told, I will only visit Universal Studios Singapore again on themed nights like this year’s Halloween Horror Nights. Masterfully done with 5 horror houses. Actors and animators are not invasive but still guaranteed a good scare. Queue to the attraction rides that are open are shorter - as I would imagine compared to a normal day in the park. Catch the horror nights while you can.",Universal Studios Singapore

It was a very hot sunny day but all of the shops and restaurants were fully airconditioned. The rides were so much fun and definitely think about buying the fast past to skip the lines it was worth the extra $50. Sad we didn’t see Elmo as my nearly 2 year old loves him but were told only 1 Sesame Street character comes out a day! My 21 month old went on 4 rides and he loved it,Universal Studios Singapore
IanMichelle2013,5.0,"October 28, 2018",Great day of fun,"Had a day in Universal studies last year and probably apart from the original in LA this place is my favourite place.

Highly recommended!!",Universal Studios Singapore
itsStanley,4.0,"October 27, 2018",A Happy Place,"First of all the see the Universal Studio Globe, that is free because it outside the theme park gate. There will be a lot of people around it for photos during the day time.  The price of the ticket may be pricey but it what you can expect from a theme park. I recommend to purchase the ticket online, for saving but skip the normal queue. The theme park split in 7 section with different amazing theme environment. Some ride could be a long wait, however the Mummy and Transformer ride will be more for worth waiting for. The Mummy ride you cannot bring in your bag, so you have to store it in a locker. There a free locker hire in the Mummy section but it free for only a certain amount of time (Can't remember). I highly recommend to get the Express Pass so go in a much shorter line, it may be pricey but it depend how much do you value your time waiting.  A good tip from me, I know waiting for the popular ride, may take up to 90min, it hot and frustrating. But my tip was to come back to for the ride later in the afternoon as it will die out and everyone leaving from a long day and I end up only waiting for 5min to get on.  Overall it was a great day out!",Universal Studios Singapore
alfyjohn,5.0,"October 27, 2018",Fantastic place to be,Arrived on a weekday ( Wednesday) and did not have to wait long as I did online ticketing from rwsentosa site. At sharp 10 am gates were open and as we arrived early quickly got in with no issues whatsoever. Universal studios is a must see attraction when you are in Singapore. Tried most of the rides and not much queues being middle of the week. Enjoyed Revenge of the mummy ride. Kids went to all rides. Jurassic park family ride was the best. We enjoyed Madagascar boat ride.,Universal Studios Singapore

IndicSam,5.0,"October 27, 2018",A solid day of fun for the family!,"The park is a full day of family fun - 7 'sections', Sci-Fi city has the best rides, Ancient Egypt has one & the Waterworld show is totally worth it, as is the unlimited express pass, you can't do all the rides you want to multiple times without it, even on a weekday.  The con: Tried booking online, price shown was $72 for adults / $56 for children + $50 Unlimited Express Pass each. Booking failed a few times, had to buy tickets at location: $76 each, adults or children + $70 each for Unlimited Express Pass each, what a scam.",Universal Studios Singapore
Kunal Raj Mehta,5.0,"October 26, 2018",A must visit if you are visiting Singapore,"You need to give this place one full day. Get yourself there by 10am or earlier so that you can run in (literally) to get in line for the transformers ride. It is by far the best ride i've ever been on. The universal studios gives you a great insight into film making and also has multiple amusement centers (movie related). There are real time action scenes re-created, stories re-told and memories that will stay with you for a long time. Keep yourself hydrated as there will be a lot of walking to be done. The place is totally operational with all necessary facilities.

Top tips go mid week and where you can to avoid queuing op for single rider on the rides, this cuts the waiting time right down",Universal Studios Singapore
jamieohalloran,5.0,"October 26, 2018",Ride the movies,"Fun day out at the Sentosa park. I bought my tickets online and you will have to redeem at the Waterfront Station (*kiosk at bottom of escalator), then got in for opening at 10am for a full day. Queues can get long (even on non-peak days) around 30-60min waits so I suggest heading for popular rides first like Transformers, Battle Star Galactica and the Mummy. Note that Jurassic Park doesn't open until 11am.  There are some really decent rides at the park. Transformers and Jurassic Park river rapids were great and the Cylon rollercoaster such a thrill. The more kid-freindly areas of Far Far Away, Madagascar and Sesame St were also really fun (loved the nostalgic Seasame Street ride and Shrek 4D always a pleasure).  I only ate at some of the food carts rather than restaurants/counter service, but what I had was good and good value too. There are good shops too and each have certain merch you won't find in others or the main store, so worth going into all.  There are lockers available for use, which some rides force you to use. Battlestar Galactica ones are free for a certain period of time but others cost around $4 for 1hr or $20 for the day. You can also buy Express Pass in most stores, but I didn't bother and queued as the wait wasn't too bad if you time it right.  But overall a great day out and recommend highly!",Universal Studios Singapore
DeSilva2014,5.0,"October 26, 2018",Wonderful experience,It was a wonderful experience for kids and adults a like. We had 4 kids ranging 5 to 11 in our group with adults aged 40 to 70. The experience was awesome for all irrespective of age. All the rides were exciting. But best for me was the Water World pirate performance. Beautifully executed. Madagascar was soft and enjoyable to start with. As you move through Shrek and Mummy rides it takes you to a whole different dreamworld. A trip to Singapore specially for Universal Studio is fully worth.,Universal Studios Singapore
Mae Balmer,4.0,"October 25, 2018",Universal Studio Singapore,It was a fun experienced here at Universal Studio Singapore.

In 1990 I last came to Singapore and this island didn't exist at all. In told this incredible island is reclamation from the sea. The bridge is new too. This links the island to the mainland. A new hotel and over units are built here. The campas is full universal classics . SPIDERMAN, Potter, Cat in the hat, Jurassic Park and more. Food outlets are good too.

Laurel A,4.0,"October 25, 2018",Great family day,"This was a fun family outing day. Bring hats, sunscreen, & Fans. We opted for the fast passes- definitely do that as the lines for some rides were pretty long and we had a 5/6 year old. It's not just the waiting time but the heat and humidity combined that made it hard to line up. So definitely splurge on the fast passes. We chose to start our time going to the 'left' side of the park when you get through the entrance. I think the first ride was a Madagascar ride. It was a great warm up. We have a small sized child so it was good to take her on rides for her size straight away. The food was not great- and pricy- amusement park food, but I was not expecting much in the way of food to be honest anyway. The park got crowded during the afternoon. I think we left around 3. There's a lot of walking so wear sneakers. There's a water ride, so maybe have a change of clothes for the littles.",Universal Studios Singapore
johny b,1.0,"October 25, 2018",One of the worst way to spend a day in Singapore,"The overall experience was terrible. The cost was high (76 S$ for adult) and after paying such a high price, one has to wait for atleast 1.5 to 2 hours before getting into the popular rides i.e. Mummy, Transformer, Jurassic park. The management has taken no initiative to ensure that waiting time is reduced at each ride..The number of people entering the park should be restricted...Imagine waiting in the queue for 2 hours and then 5-10 minutes of enjoyment and then back to the queue..If you are with small kids, it makes the matter worse esp due to hot and humid weather.. Even with express tickets which costs 50% more, there is waiting time..I have been to Disney and they have organised it so well..Universal, (esp Singapore) should learn from Disney.. Overall, I would never ever go back to Singapore Universal and would not recommend it to anyone either...",Universal Studios Singapore

As we are older we only went on a couple of rides which was the water ride at Jurassic Park and the Madagascar boat ride which was more sedate. Make sure to remove shoes or wear flip flops as you become very wet. It pays to arrive early as the waiting times for rides can become very long, we arrived at 10.30 as the park was opening. We enjoyed looking at all the different attractions and would be wonderful to take children to but bearing in mind that food, drinks and gift shops are expensive. Great place to visit.",Universal Studios Singapore
Bec P,3.0,"October 23, 2018",Worth a visit,"After being to the universal studios in Orlando and California, Singapore is significantly smaller. The one thing I do highly recommend is taking full advantage of the child swap programme. Cut waiting time down and allowed both myself and my husband a chance to do the rides without both having to wait. If you have a child that is unable to ride, simply approach the queue and advise the attendant that you would like to child swap, they will give the second adult an express pass for when the first gets off and if there is a single rider option then it’s quick for both parties. The souvenirs were really overpriced and didn’t even compare to the US prices. If you have the time and kids, then worth a visit but I wouldn’t bank the whole holiday around it",Universal Studios Singapore
Ha Eun K,2.0,"October 23, 2018",Out of expectation,"I visited this place on April 4th with a high expectation of my own kind of ""Universal Studios"". I expected that it would be the best amusement park/attraction I would ever go to but it turned out to be so unbelievably out of expectation.  First of all, I was disappointed with the price because as soon as I went in and walked around for 10 minutes, I had nothing to do and the price was quite expensive. Second of all, there were only a few rides that were mostly like roller coasters but there were no other rides except for few roller coasters. All there was a few shops of souvenirs--which were expensive and easy to break.  There were some things that were really cute souvenirs to just look around. There was not much to do but I was strolling around the place, just to see if there is anything else and I had fun exercising.  So I was really disappointed with how the quality and thought it was unworthy to give that much money to really go in the Universal Studios.  I don't really recommend this place too much but if you really want to go, I would say 1-2 hours trip can be fine. I found the roller coasters amusing and scary while I rode it and that was one thing I did that was not so bad.",Universal Studios Singapore

The rude man at the transformers attraction asks only Indian looking people to show their fast pass. Even we once showed it at the entrance at the start of the attraction line. He did not ask the white or Chinese people. I think the country is full of racist like this one. The attraction is small and many queue jumpers, rude people, depress looking racist staff members. They should go to Disneyland and learn how attractions should be run. Everything is overpriced. Went to pizza place in the universal studio and pizza was 50-60 dollars. The whole country is overpriced for everything with racist people as a bonus. I would never visit this concrete jungle again.",Universal Studios Singapore

Karen B,2.0,"October 22, 2018",Halloween horror night not worth it,"Went on a ‘non peak’ night, would hate to see it on a peak night. Absolutely recommend the express pass if you want to see each house else in the 5 hours you’ll be lucky to see 2 maybe 3 due to the crowds, the houses are good but the scare factor is low when there is no space between you and the person in front, you already know what’s going to happen. Expect to wait in a massive crowd of people for 40mins before even entering, they play entertainment on the screen but if you are short like me you will see nothing. Lines for the other few rides were at least an hour wait. Characters and zone were good but again too overcrowded to enjoy. Overrated and not worth it",Universal Studios Singapore

Safety is given utmost importance. However one must be patient enough to wait out their turn unles you are willing to spend another additional S$ 70 for an express line queue.

Mazmannan,4.0,"October 21, 2018",Fun day for family,"Universal Studios is located on Sentosa Island.  You should plan to spend the whole day there because there are so many things to see, do and experience.  The rides are very popular - and you need to try and get there early to avoid the queues that inevitably build up later on during the day. Sometime the waiting times can be over an hour.  I went on the Transformer ride - and it was excellent - very thrilling and enjoyable. The Waterworld show was fantastic. Lots of action and noise. This is a popular show.  There are also rides at the Jurassic Park and Madagascar.  Times passes by very quickly.  Food and drinks are available - but on the pricey side. But that is to be expected when you are in a Universal Studios park - because you don't really have any other option.  I have been to other Universal studios around the world - and they are all similar and much of a muchness.

The only concern that I have is they have the height criteria for many of the rides I wish they had the same criteria for paying too. They should charge based on height as I feel my kid missed many of the rides because of height concerns. But overall we enjoyed our day at Universal studio. The water world show was amazing, the roller coaster was good, the mummy ride was great and the best was transformer (Great that we had our kid along).

Esta G,1.0,"October 21, 2018",Food is expensive and disappointing!,"Brought my family consisting of my elderly parents, Brother, Husband and myself to celebrate my mother’s birthday. Visited the Mel’s Drive-In, their crispy chicken burger with fries is already SGD$15, ala carte drink is SGD$4. Total cost per pax is easily SGD$20. Similarly, at StarBot Cafe, a bah ku teh is SGD$15, with only a pathetic 2-3 pieces of meat. Their poached chicken is served as a cold dish and not elderly friendly. On top of that, the quality of food is at best mediocre. From these, you can easily see 3 bones of contention we had of this universal studio Singapore: (1) Not very elderly friendly, (2) Price is exorbitant (when did it rise to S$15 per dish?? , and (3) Food quality is poor representation of Singapore food and not of a certain standards worthy of its price tag.

BGSchmidt,3.0,"October 17, 2018",Tailored for older kids and adults especially the rides,"We went as a family to the Universal Studio in Singapore. The entrance ticket pricing was reasonable but the wait for rides were pretty long so we got the express pass for us. The only thing about the pass is that it would be worthwhile IF your kid is older as most rides, in my opinion, would be quite scary for under 5. Ours was four at the time and some rides were too scary for him or too much for his age. Of course it depends on your kid also. I wouldn’t have bought the express pass if I had known there would be so few rides tailored for younger kids. The one that younger kids would love but the express pass could not be use and the wait is over an hour.  The things that our kid did love were the boat ride, the meet the transformers and the Sesame Street theatre.  In summary, an alright experience for us but would not go back any time soon.",Universal Studios Singapore

The rides were extremely well presented and, on a typical weekday, the queuing was remarkably light. Also, the various attraction shows were extremely well done and the effects were wonderful, especially for the children As can be expected, the place tries to extract every ounce of cash it can from you while you are there, but the prices are what you would expect for a captive audience on a unique day out. Overall, I would say, ‘don’t miss a day out here’if you are in Singapore as Universal Studios here does reflect the more well known Hollywood version in a most positive way.",Universal Studios Singapore

But i know it might be quite expensive but u will surely love it. 3 rides we really have fun is the Transformer, the one with the boat in Jurassic park and roller coaster..( i forgot the names of that rides)  Once you reach there, get the map first so will know what are the places you can visit inside the US. Come before 10am so that u will have enough time for your tours and enjoy all the rides.  The easiest way going to sentosa universal studio is by riding the metro.  Someday, we will come back and visit US again",Universal Studios Singapore
affma,5.0,"October 15, 2018",Fun!,"I really enjoyed the park and I was able to go during the Halloween! I loved the Cylon Battlestar Galactica and Transformer Rides. Also worth to try the Pizza at Louis. 1 day is enough to visit everything if the lines are not too big. During the Halloween, 5 haunted houses were included and I was able to see them all plus the shows, however lines were very long. A bit tiring.",Universal Studios Singapore
naf,3.0,"October 15, 2018","Fun, a few bits to improve though","As an adult who was going to Universal studios for the first time, I'd say it was fun, but you can obviously tell it's small. There are approx 5 attractions that I would say adults really enjoy, the battlestar galactica rollercoasters, the mummy, jurassic park rapids and the transformers simulator. The problem is that half of those are external so if it rains they'll close until its safe to operate. So if its a group of adults only, maybe triple check the weather cos you'll miss the best part if it starts raining.  It would be a lot better though if they didnt charge you for the lockers (45min for free and then you need to pay to reopen them). I mean...if they dont allow you to bring anything (which is logic of course) you should have a safe place for your stuff, period. Specially on the battlestar rollercoasters you're not even allowed to have anything in your pockets..not even if they have zippers, which we were surprised. There's no sign warning about that so you had to start queuing just to have the guy stop you at the entrance and send you back to the lockers, not very friendly I'd say. And then you see people in the queue with hats and little stuff that they were allowed to leave on little shelfs before boarding thte game so...????  Waterworld show is cool, worth paying a visit.  Crowd control also not very good, we saw people cutting the line to bring in more of their friends, lying their *** off and they were allowed to go in with zero control.  The other bad aspect is that the opening hours are short, opens at 10 and closes at 6 so if you think about it you're paying almost 10 singapore dollars to be there...when you can easily have lines of 1 hour for the main games, not a lot of time really.",Universal Studios Singapore
Darren B,4.0,"October 15, 2018",Good day out,Slightly compact version of Florida's Universal Studios. All very well done. Quite busy though even on a Monday out of school holidays. Average wait 1 hour for main rides. Park is on Sentosa Island reached by Mono-rail where there are other attractions too.,Universal Studios Singapore

NorthStar824377,1.0,"October 14, 2018",Halloween Horror Nights 8 - what a nightmare,"Halloween Horror Nights 8. The true horror of the night was the park’s handling of the event.  Less than 5 hours to cover 2 scare zones, 3 shows and 5 haunted houses.  There was a 45 min wait just to get inside the park. Once inside, the typical wait for each house was around 120-180 mins. There was no way anyone could enjoy the event in its entirety.  The park maximized its revenues, but it left visitors with an incomplete and unpleasant experience.",Universal Studios Singapore
rina T,5.0,"October 13, 2018",Great day,"Had a great day here , went on a Thursday, not too busy , was hot , not too long in waiting for rides , around 15 mins, my son was only 9 so we don’t do the 2 big rides , brought in own water bottles and found fountains around the place to refill, arrived at 10 am bought tickets through Klook , scanned barcodes on phone at the gate easy , left at 4 pm !",Universal Studios Singapore
Gaurav Dua,4.0,"October 13, 2018","Great Fun Family Time, Awesome Indian Food - But.",Universal studios is quite smaller as compared to that of LA and i did miss the great tram ride tour which i was very excited to show to my wife sadly doesn’t run in Singapore.  Many rides were kid friendly and my boy had a great fun time.  Indian food at Egypt section is outstanding and not to be missed is mutton tikka and roasted chicken.  Overall happy family time as my wife and kid were happy but in my personal opinion it’s not even 60% of universal los angles.  But still a must go if you haven’t been to Americas Universal Studios.,Universal Studios Singapore
Christopher H,3.0,"October 13, 2018",Feels Outdated,A fun day out albeit the theme park feels aged and in need of a refresh. The two larger roller coasters are enjoyable but their themes are several generations outdated and the rides not overly thrilling. The newer Transformers ride is very well and a must for fans of the movies!,Universal Studios Singapore
Swapna Sebastian,5.0,"October 13, 2018",Universal Studios Singapore,"Universal Studios in Singapore is a theme park located within Resorts World Sentosa on Sentosa Island, Singapore. In South east Asia, i think its the only one. The place is divided into 7 zones. A detailed info can be found in Wikipedia. We enjoyed the Shrek's Far Far Away 4D movie and Madagascar theme rides. But the best was The lost world, as per my kids. They loved the Dinos. We visited the place on a Sunday and hence, were able to see the Disney Parade which was a lot of fun for the kids. The place is alive with stage shows and street shows which are drool worthy. Its tiring if you have small kids with you because it takes one whole day to somehow manage seeing a good part of it.",Universal Studios Singapore
Isabella2003,3.0,"October 13, 2018",It’s ok,"Typical theme park, long queues, overpriced food, we went during week and still very busy, did look at getting express passes but thought $110 was a bit much on top of the ticket price. All staff seemed very friendly",Universal Studios Singapore
CandyCritic,4.0,"October 12, 2018",A fun day out,"While this being a fairly small theme park in size, they use the size very well. Each themed land is very detailed and there’s always plenty to see. We visited on a weekday and it wasn’t very busy at all, for the first few hours most rides were a 5 or 10 minute wait. As the day went on, things got a bit more crowded, but nothing too unbearable. I’d imagine however that on a busy weekend or holiday things might be a little more insane.  The rides were a little hit or miss. Some were very immersive and fun, others were thrilling, some seemed a bit weaker but still fairly enjoyable. The food was okay as well, although if you want better food it’s worth going out of the park as it’s surrounded by better options (albeit more expensive).",Universal Studios Singapore
David M,4.0,"October 12, 2018",Great rides and the best stunt show.,"The stunts performed in the WaterWorld were shockingly entertaining. The best stunt shows we have seen, compared to the US in Japan and Australia.",Universal Studios Singapore
