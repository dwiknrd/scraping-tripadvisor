Bian,5.0," May 18, 2021",Universal Studios Singapore,"Universal Studios Singapore opened in 2010. It is part of the Resorts World Sentosa complex on Sentosa Island. I love that each themed zone has its own attractions, shopping, eating establishments and street entertainment. There were rides, street performances, live shows and movie characters. Some of these are available in other theme parks. My favorite is the Water World which showed incredible performances, it has stunt stars in action and a sound stage with special effects where you can experience a hurricane in New York. As well as the Shrek 4-D Adventure. This place is a great attraction to visit for family and friends. One day tour is not enough to experience all the fantastic rides inside Universal Studios Singapore. I rate this destination with 5 stars because I really enjoyed our tour and it never failed to amaze me.",Universal Studios Singapore

MuhdMikhail,4.0," April 25, 2021","Great experience,bad incident with guest operations","Hi,I just want to say that i did enjot my time at Universal studious Singapore.I managed to take all the rides and had a very memorable day there with the rides. The food was great,atmosphere was good and all the rides had reasonable queue times. I just have one bad experience,mainly at the Far far away.Just as i alighted the Puss-in-Boots ride,and was heading out,i was walking out and a lot of people were walking out too.So I accidentally walked a bit out of line and wanted to walk out.Yes it’s my fault for that,however,one of the worker procceeded to stretch his arm out to my stomach and push me back to line. A simple warning or just telling me to get back would have been okay,but i feel like having contact like that,is not tolerable honestly.Luckily i kept my cool and just walked off,but i feel like the workers should be more patient and carry out their guest operations more calmly,not with physical contact.Yes,it was my fault rhat i walked out of line,but it was really minimal and didn’y deserve to get an arm to my stomach.I too noticed a worker at the Farfaraway dragon ride that shouted at another person because she was taking her time to walk up the stairs after the ride. Guest management should be better at the Farfaraway,and i hope this would go a long way. All the other attractions had excellent to good guest operations,and i really commend it. Would come again!",Universal Studios Singapore
Harald F,2.0," April 12, 2021",Not worth it,"Many attractions closed, but still full price. No information about this when booking.  I dont think the estimated waiting time functions for the different attractions are correct. Because of covid, every second row of seats on rides are left unused. This doubles the waiting time estimated. Ended up waiting 1 hour + for rides lasting maybe a few minutes.",Universal Studios Singapore
Sam,1.0," April 9, 2021",No,"On a non-holiday Friday, rides start @ 2pm and each ride has an estimated waiting time of 90mins, which means you are gonna spend 3 hours on the line for every 2 minutes worth of rides.  Food is terrible and overpriced, and it rained when I visited so most rides were closed. Pretty sure I will never ever visit again in my lifetime.",Universal Studios Singapore
